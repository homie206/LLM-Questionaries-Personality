Iteration 2 answer: In the heart of winter, when the world seemed to freeze over, I found myself in a small town nestled among the mountains. The air was crisp, and the sky was a brilliant shade of blue, but the biting cold made it feel more like a frosty prison than a place of beauty. This wasn't my first visit to the town; it was a place where I had once lost myself and had found a new purpose.

I had been there for a few weeks, working as a volunteer teacher at the local school. It was a simple task—teaching English to children who were eager to learn. Yet, it was the most challenging experience I had ever encountered. The kids were full of energy, their laughter echoing through the halls, and their curiosity about the world was infectious.

As we walked, I noticed something else about Miguel. He was quiet, but he listened intently. He asked questions, even when I didn’t expect him to. When we reached the summit, I pointed out the stars twinkling in the night sky and explained how they were like distant lanterns guiding us through the universe. Miguel looked up at the stars, his eyes wide with awe, and said softly, "They look like fireflies, don’t they?"

From that moment on, Miguel became one of my closest students. He started coming to class every day, eager to learn more about the world beyond his small town. He was
