Iteration 5 answer: In the heart of New York City, there's an old, winding staircase that leads up to a small café nestled among the towering skyscrapers. It’s called "The Staircase Café," and it’s where I first met the owner, Maria. She was a woman with a captivating aura, her eyes sparkling with a mix of warmth and mystery. Her café wasn't just about coffee; it was a place where people came to gather, to talk, and to feel seen.
