Iteration 5 answer: In the heart of summer, I found myself in a small coastal town, a place where the sea breeze carried the scent of salt and the horizon was always just out of reach. This particular year, my family had decided to spend a week there, and I was eager to explore every nook and cranny of this new environment.

I had grown up in a bustling city, surrounded by towering skyscrapers and endless noise. The idea of spending a week in a quaint seaside town seemed like an escape from the chaos of my daily life. As we settled into our rented cottage, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. The thought of having too much free time was daunting, but also exhilarating.
