Iteration 5 answer: In the heart of a bustling city lived a young woman named Eliza. She had always been an avid reader, devouring books that transported her to far-off lands and times. Her favorite pastime was escaping into the pages of novels where she could find solace from the chaos of daily life. Eliza was a high school teacher, a role that required patience, creativity, and a deep understanding of her students' unique journeys.

One particularly challenging year began when Eliza noticed a significant drop in her students' engagement levels.
