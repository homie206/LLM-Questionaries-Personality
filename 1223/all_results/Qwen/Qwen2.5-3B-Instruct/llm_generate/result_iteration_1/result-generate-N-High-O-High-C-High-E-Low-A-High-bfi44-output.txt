Iteration 1 answer: In the quiet, sun-dappled courtyard of an old Victorian house in the heart of London, I found myself surrounded by the familiar scents of lavender and freshly baked bread. It was my favorite spot for afternoon tea, where I would sip Earl Grey and ponder life’s complexities. That particular afternoon, however, was different.
