Iteration 1 answer: In the heart of a bustling city, there was a young woman named Eliza who had always felt like she was living someone else's life. She worked long hours at a corporate job, meticulously planning her days to fit into the mold of what society expected of her. Her weekends were filled with endless social engagements, trying to impress others with her polished appearance and well-rehearsed conversations.

Eliza’s life was predictable and somewhat monotonous. She didn’t have much time for herself, and when she did, it was usually spent in front of a screen or in a crowded room where she could blend in without being noticed.
