Iteration 4 answer: In the heart of a bustling city stood a small, cozy café called "Whispers." It was a place where the walls seemed to hold stories of every soul who had ever walked through its doors. The café was run by a woman named Eliza, who had inherited it from her grandmother. Eliza was a gentle soul, but she had a unique way of running the café that made it a haven for many.
