Iteration 4 answer: In the quiet town of Millbrook, nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, there lived an old man named Henry. He was known for his wisdom and his love for solitude. Henry spent most of his days in his modest cottage, surrounded by books and tools he had collected over the years. His life was simple, almost monastic in its routine. He rarely ventured outside his home, except for the occasional walk through the fields that bordered his property.

Henry had a peculiar way of solving problems that intrigued everyone who knew him. His neighbors would often ask him for advice, expecting the usual sage wisdom he was known for. But Henry’s solutions were never the grand gestures or elaborate plans they might have been expecting. Instead, he would simply gather some tools and set off into the fields, returning later with a small, unexpected solution to their issues.

When the day arrived, Henry showed up with only a few bags of supplies—bags filled with small, discarded items like broken toys, bits of plastic, and other miscellaneous debris.

When the sun began to set, Henry gathered his friends and explained, "Sometimes, the best solutions are found when we look beyond what we see. We don’t need to invent something new; we just need to find the potential in what already exists."

Inspired by Henry’s unconventional yet effective methods, the young friends returned home with renewed enthusiasm. They used the same principles to organize their community clean-up event. They found creative ways to reuse the collected materials, creating art installations and even a small greenhouse. The project became a community-wide success, and Henry’s
