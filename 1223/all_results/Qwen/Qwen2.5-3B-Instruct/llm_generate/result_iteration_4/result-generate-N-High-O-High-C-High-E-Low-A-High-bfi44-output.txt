Iteration 4 answer: In the heart of a bustling city, there was a small, quaint bookstore nestled on the corner of a quaint street. It was an old-fashioned place with high ceilings and wooden floors that creaked under the weight of footsteps. The air inside was filled with the scent of aged paper and the faint aroma of coffee from the counter.
