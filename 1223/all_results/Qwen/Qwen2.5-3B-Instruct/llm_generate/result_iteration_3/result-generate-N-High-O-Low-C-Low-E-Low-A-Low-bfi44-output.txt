Iteration 3 answer: In the heart of a bustling city, there was a small café that had been my refuge for years. It was a quaint little place tucked away in a corner of the city, known for its cozy atmosphere and the warm smiles of the barista, Sarah. I had frequented this café since I moved into the city five years ago, making it a place where I could escape the chaos of daily life and immerse myself in the tranquility of a good cup of coffee.
