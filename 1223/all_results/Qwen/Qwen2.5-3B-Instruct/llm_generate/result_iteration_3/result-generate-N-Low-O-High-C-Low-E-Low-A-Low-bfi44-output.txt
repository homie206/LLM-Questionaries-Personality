Iteration 3 answer: In the quiet town of Willow Creek, nestled between rolling hills and a whispering forest, lived a man named Jack. He was known for his quiet demeanor and his unwavering commitment to his work as a carpenter.

His days were filled with hammering nails, sawing wood, and crafting furniture that would grace homes around the region.

Jack’s hands were calloused from years of hard labor, and his face bore the lines of someone who had seen many seasons pass.
