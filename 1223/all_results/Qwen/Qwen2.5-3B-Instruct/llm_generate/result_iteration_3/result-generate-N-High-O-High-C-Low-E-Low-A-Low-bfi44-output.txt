Iteration 3 answer: In the quiet town of Willow Creek, nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, lived an elderly woman named Eliza. She had lived there all her life, her house perched on the highest point overlooking the valley. Her days were filled with the same routine—morning walks through the gardens, afternoon tea with friends, and evening strolls along the riverbank. However, even in this seemingly peaceful existence, Eliza felt an underlying tension that she couldn't shake.
