Iteration 3 answer: In the quiet town of Millbrook, nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, there lived a young woman named Eliza. She was a high school senior with aspirations of pursuing a career in environmental science. Eliza's days were filled with her studies, her afternoons spent volunteering at the local nature center, and her evenings dedicated to writing essays and researching projects. Her life seemed perfectly balanced until one fateful summer.

Eliza had always been fascinated by the vast expanse of the Amazon rainforest, a place she had only seen through photographs and documentaries.
