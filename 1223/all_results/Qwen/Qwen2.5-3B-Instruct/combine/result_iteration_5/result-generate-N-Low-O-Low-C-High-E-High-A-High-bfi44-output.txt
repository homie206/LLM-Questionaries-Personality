Iteration 5 answer: In the heart of New York City, where skyscrapers touch the clouds and the hustle and bustle of life never seems to cease, there lived a young woman named Maya. She was a high school teacher, known for her infectious smile and passion for teaching. Her days were filled with students who, like any group of teenagers, had their ups and downs. One particular day stood out as an example of both the resilience she exhibited and the profound impact she had on her students.

Maya had a class that was notoriously difficult—students who struggled with discipline issues and academic challenges. It was a Friday afternoon, and the usual chaos had settled into a quiet tension. Maya walked into the classroom, her usual bright smile fading slightly as she noticed the subdued atmosphere. She knew she had to do something to lift everyone's spirits before they went home for the weekend.

She decided to start with a simple game of "Two Truths and a Lie." This activity, though straightforward, always brought laughter and engagement. As she introduced the game, she made sure to include one of her own truths to make it more relatable. The room began to lighten up; students started sharing their stories, and soon enough, the air was filled with the sound of giggles and excited chatter.

After the game, Maya asked the students if anyone wanted to share something personal. To her surprise, a shy boy raised his hand. He had been absent from school for the past week due to an illness, and he hadn't spoken to anyone about it. His classmates listened intently as he shared his story. Maya listened without judgment, offering a comforting pat on the back when necessary.

The conversation continued, and Maya noticed that the boy seemed visibly relieved. She then turned to the class and said, "Remember how we talked about setting goals last week? I think today's discussion might help us all set some personal goals for the coming weeks."

The students nodded eagerly, and Maya continued, "I want each of you to write down three things you can work on this summer to improve yourself in areas that matter to you. Whether it’s learning a new skill, spending more time with family, or improving your health, let’s make this summer count."

The room buzzed with excitement as students wrote their goals. Maya observed each student, ensuring that everyone felt comfortable and heard. By the end of the class, the boy who had been so quiet earlier was sitting at the front, pen in hand, ready to tackle his goal of improving his grades.

That evening, Maya
