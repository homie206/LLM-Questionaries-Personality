Iteration 5 answer: Lena had always been an outgoing person who loved nothing more than being at the center of attention. She was known for her infectious laugh and her ability to make even the most awkward situation seem light-hearted. Lena was the life of the party, and she thrived on the excitement and energy of crowds. She could spend hours talking to strangers, sharing stories, and making friends wherever she went.
