Iteration 3 answer: Lila had always been an introvert, preferring the quiet comfort of her own company over the bustling energy of crowds. She was a librarian at a local university, a role that suited her well since she found solace in the stacks of books and the calm of her office. Her days were filled with the routine of shelving books, checking out new arrivals, and assisting patrons who sought information on various subjects. 

One particular day, Lila was particularly busy. The library was abuzz with students studying, professors preparing lectures, and researchers working on their projects. Amidst this chaos, Lila noticed a group of students sitting together, engrossed in animated conversation. They seemed to have found a comfortable spot near the window, where the light filtered through the blinds, casting gentle shadows on the floor.

Lila had always admired these students; they exuded confidence and a natural ease in their interactions. However, today, something about them struck her as different. It wasn't until she saw one of the students, a young man named Max, looking lost and fidgety, that she realized how much she missed being able to connect with people authentically.

Max had just finished his final year of college and was now trying to decide what he wanted to do next. He had been struggling to find direction and felt like he was drowning in options. Lila watched him from afar, her heart aching for him. She knew firsthand how daunting the process could be, having gone through similar phases herself.

Feeling a sudden urge to help, Lila decided to approach Max. She made her way to his table, her steps deliberate yet hesitant. "Hi," she said softly, hoping her voice would reassure him. "I noticed you seemed a bit off today."

Max looked up, surprised by her approach. His eyes met hers, and there was a moment of silence before he spoke. "Yeah, I've been thinking a lot lately," he admitted. "About my future."

Lila nodded, understanding. "That can be tough, especially when you're trying to figure out what you want to do. But you know what? You don't have to figure everything out right away. Sometimes, it's okay to take things one step at a time."

Max sighed, his shoulders slumping slightly. "I guess you're right," he mumbled.

Lila smiled warmly. "Absolutely. Why don't we grab some coffee? It'll give us a chance to chat without the distraction of everyone else around here."
