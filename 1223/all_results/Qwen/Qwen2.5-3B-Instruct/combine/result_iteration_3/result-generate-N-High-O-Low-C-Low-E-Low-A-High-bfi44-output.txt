Iteration 3 answer: Lena had always been a quiet and reserved individual, often spending her days immersed in books or lost in thought. She was content with the familiarity of her routine, preferring the predictability of her life over the unpredictability of new experiences. Lena’s world was a tapestry woven from the threads of her past, and she treasured each thread, even if they were sometimes faded and worn.

One summer, Lena's peace was disrupted when her younger sister, Sarah, returned home after years away. Sarah had recently graduated from college and was eager to reconnect with her family.
