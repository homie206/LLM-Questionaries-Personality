Iteration 3 answer: In the quiet town of Millfield, nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, lived an elderly man named Mr. Thompson. He was known to all as a man who never missed a day of work and always greeted the neighbors with a warm smile. His house, a simple stone cottage, was often filled with the sound of his woodworking tools and the aroma of freshly baked bread from his oven.

Mr. Thompson had been a carpenter for over fifty years, his hands calloused from years of working with wood. He had built many houses in Millfield, each one a testament to his craftsmanship.

"What's wrong, Tommy?" Mr. Thompson asked softly.

"I... I don't know what to do," Tommy admitted, his voice trembling slightly. "My dad says he won't let me stay here anymore if I keep breaking things. And my mom... she's sick."

Mr. Thompson nodded, understanding the gravity of Tommy's situation. He knew that this wasn't just about a naughty boy; it was about
