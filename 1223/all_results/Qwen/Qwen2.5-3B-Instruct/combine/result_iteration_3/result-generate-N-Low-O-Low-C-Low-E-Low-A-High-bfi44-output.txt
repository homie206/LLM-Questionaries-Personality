Iteration 3 answer: In the heart of a bustling city lived a man named Tom. He was an accountant by profession and had been working at the same firm for over a decade. Tom's life seemed like any other ordinary day until one day, his younger sister, Lisa, came to him with a plea. Lisa was struggling financially and needed money urgently to pay her tuition fees, but she didn't know where to turn.

Tom felt a mixture of emotions—guilt, worry, and a sense of responsibility towards his sister. His mind raced with thoughts of how he could help without compromising his job or financial stability. He knew that borrowing money from his employer was risky and could jeopardize his career. However, seeing Lisa’s tearful face made him realize that he couldn’t let her down.
