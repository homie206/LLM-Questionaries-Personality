Iteration 1 answer: In the heart of New York City, where towering skyscrapers stretch towards the sky like giants guarding their secrets, I found myself standing on the edge of Central Park. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the winding paths and lakes, but it was the way the light played on the water that captured my attention. It was a day like any other, yet it felt different. My mind wandered back to an old friend who had moved away years ago, and how we used to spend our afternoons here, just the two of us.
