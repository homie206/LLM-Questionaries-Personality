It was a typical Monday morning, and I was already feeling the weight of the week ahead. The alarm had gone off, but I lay in bed, unable to shake off the fog that seemed to settle over me every weekend. As a university student, I found myself juggling assignments, part-time jobs, and social commitments, all while trying to maintain a semblance of normalcy amidst the chaos.
