I was always the kid who thrived on excitement. My parents, both of whom were engineers, instilled in me a love for science and technology from an early age. However, it wasn't until I hit my teens that I discovered something that truly set my heart racing: the thrill of adventure and exploration.

Growing up, my family lived in various places around the world, which gave me a unique perspective on different cultures and ways of life. Each move brought its own set of challenges, but also opportunities to learn and grow.
