The sun was setting over the bustling city, casting long shadows across the streets. Sarah stood at the edge of a bridge, her eyes scanning the crowd below. The city had always been a place of contrasts for her; one moment filled with the vibrant energy of life, the next filled with the quiet solitude she so craved. Tonight, she felt an unusual mix of excitement and unease. She had just landed a major promotion at work, but it came with a significant relocation to another city.

Sarah had always been a creature of habit. Her mornings were punctuated by the same routine—coffee, yoga, and a quick breakfast before heading off to her office.
