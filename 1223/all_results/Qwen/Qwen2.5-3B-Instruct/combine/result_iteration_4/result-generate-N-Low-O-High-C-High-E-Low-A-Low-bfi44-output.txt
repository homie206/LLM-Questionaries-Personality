Iteration 4 answer: In the quiet town of Millbrook, nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, lived a young man named Jack. He was known by his friends and neighbors for his quiet demeanor and love for solitude, often found lost in the woods with a book or sketchpad in hand. His parents were both doctors who worked long hours, leaving Jack to navigate his days largely on his own.

Jack's world was simple but fulfilling. He had a small garden where he tended to flowers and vegetables, and a cozy attic that served as his sanctuary. Every morning, he would wake up early, read a bit, draw some sketches, and then start his day helping around the house.
