Iteration 4 answer: In the heart of a bustling city lived an energetic young woman named Maya. She was a vibrant figure, always brimming with life, eager to explore new places and experiences. Maya had a way of making everyone around her feel alive, and her infectious enthusiasm often drew people to her.
