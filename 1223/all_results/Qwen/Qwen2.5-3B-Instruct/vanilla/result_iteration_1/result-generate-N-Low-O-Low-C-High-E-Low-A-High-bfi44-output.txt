Iteration 1 answer: Lily had always been a bit of an outsider in her small town. She was never quite sure why, but she felt like she didn't quite fit in with the other kids at school or the adults around her. As a teenager, she found solace in reading books and spending time alone with her thoughts.

One day, while walking through the woods near her house, Lily stumbled upon an old, dilapidated cabin. The place was overgrown with wildflowers and vines, but there was something about it that intrigued her. It reminded her of the stories she used to read as a child, tales of adventure and mystery.

Determined to explore, Lily spent hours clearing away the debris until she could finally step inside.
