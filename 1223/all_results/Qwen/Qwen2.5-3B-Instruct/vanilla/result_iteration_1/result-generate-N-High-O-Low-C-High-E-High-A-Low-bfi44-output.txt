Iteration 1 answer: In my early twenties, I found myself in a challenging phase of my life. I was a recent graduate with a degree in business administration, but I had no clear idea of what I wanted to do next. The world seemed vast and full of possibilities, yet also intimidating. My mind was filled with endless questions about career paths, relationships, and the future.

I had always been ambitious, driven by a strong sense of purpose and a need to succeed. This ambition often made me feel isolated and misunderstood by those around me.

I understood that success wasn't solely measured by achievements but also by the quality of life one leads.

I started volunteering more, helping out at local organizations, and slowly shifted my focus towards work that aligned better with my values.
