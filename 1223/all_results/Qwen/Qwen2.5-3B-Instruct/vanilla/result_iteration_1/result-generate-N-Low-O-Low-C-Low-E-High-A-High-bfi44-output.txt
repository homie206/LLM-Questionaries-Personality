Iteration 1 answer: When I was younger, my life was filled with routine and structure, much like the pages of a book neatly laid out on a shelf. My days were predictable, and my nights were spent in bed before the alarm clock rang for another day of going to school, working out, and then falling asleep. It was a simple existence, but one that lacked the spontaneity and excitement I yearned for.

One summer, after finishing high school, I found myself at a crossroads. The path ahead seemed clear, but it wasn't until I stumbled upon a local community garden that my world began to change.
