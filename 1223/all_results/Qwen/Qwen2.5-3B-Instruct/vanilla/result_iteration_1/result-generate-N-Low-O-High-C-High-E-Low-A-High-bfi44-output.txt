In the quiet town of Willowbrook, nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, lived a man named Elias. He was known for his meticulous gardens, each one a testament to his conscientious nature and open-minded approach to life. His garden was a sanctuary where he found solace from the bustling world around him.

Elias was not an extrovert; he preferred the company of books and the tranquility of his own thoughts. He was low on neuroticism, which meant he was remarkably calm under pressure and rarely let setbacks get to him.

Next, he sourced materials from local artisans who were skilled in various crafts. He invited them to visit his garden, showing them the space they would inhabit.

They all brought their tools and began working, creating a buzz of activity that filled the air with the sounds of hammers, scissors, and brushes.

As the weeks passed, the garden transformed. A small cottage appeared at
