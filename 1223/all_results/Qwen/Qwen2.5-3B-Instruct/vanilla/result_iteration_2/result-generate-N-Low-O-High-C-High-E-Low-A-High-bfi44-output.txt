Iteration 2 answer: In my early twenties, I found myself at a crossroads. I had been working for a decade as an accountant at a large firm, but the monotony of numbers and the repetitive nature of the job began to weigh heavily on me. I was feeling restless, yearning for something more meaningful and fulfilling. It was during this period that I decided to take a leap of faith and enroll in a master's program in environmental science.

The decision wasn't made lightly. The course load was rigorous, and I knew it would be challenging to juggle school with my current full-time job. But there was a part of me that felt it was time to step out of my comfort zone and explore new horizons. As I prepared for the transition, I realized that I needed to make some adjustments in my life, both professional and personal.

These activities not only enriched my academic experience but also filled a void in my life that I hadn't even realized was missing. The sense of purpose and belonging I felt was profound.

As I progressed through my studies, I became more involved in campus initiatives aimed at promoting sustainability. One particular project stood out: a campaign to reduce plastic usage on campus. I coordinated with students, faculty, and staff, organizing workshops, distributing reusable bags, and creating awareness posters. The project was a success, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment and pride. Seeing the positive impact of our efforts motivated me to continue advocating for environmental
