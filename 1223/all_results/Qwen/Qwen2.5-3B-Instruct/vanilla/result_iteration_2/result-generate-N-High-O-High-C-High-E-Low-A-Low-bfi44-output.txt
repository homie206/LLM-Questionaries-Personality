Iteration 2 answer: In the quiet of my small apartment, I found myself engrossed in an old book, "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. It was a rainy afternoon, and the city outside was bustling with the usual humdrum of life. Inside my sanctuary, there was only the soft murmur of the pages turning and the distant sound of raindrops tapping against the windows.
