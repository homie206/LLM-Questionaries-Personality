Iteration 2 answer: When I was a teenager, my life seemed like an endless rollercoaster of emotions and experiences. My mother had passed away when I was just ten years old, leaving me to navigate the world on my own. The loss was a constant ache that would sometimes make me cry uncontrollably, and other times leave me feeling numb.

My father remarried, but the new stepmother wasn't the nurturing figure I needed after losing my mother. Instead, she seemed more interested in her own needs and interests, often neglecting our home and us. This made me feel abandoned and alone, which only heightened my emotional sensitivity.
