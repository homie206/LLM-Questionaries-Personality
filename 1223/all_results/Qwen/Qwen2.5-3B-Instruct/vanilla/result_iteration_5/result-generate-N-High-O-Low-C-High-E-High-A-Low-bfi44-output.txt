In the heart of a bustling city, there lived a woman named Sarah. She was an extrovert who thrived in the vibrant energy of the city, always feeling energized by the crowds and the endless possibilities that came her way.

Sarah was prone to intense feelings, often experiencing highs that were as sharp as they were fleeting, and lows that felt like they would never end.
