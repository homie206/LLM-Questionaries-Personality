Iteration 3 answer: In the quiet corner of my childhood home, nestled between towering pines and the whispering wind, I found solace in the pages of books that seemed to hold the answers to life's mysteries. My parents were both busy with their careers, and while they loved me dearly, they had little time for me beyond the daily routines.
