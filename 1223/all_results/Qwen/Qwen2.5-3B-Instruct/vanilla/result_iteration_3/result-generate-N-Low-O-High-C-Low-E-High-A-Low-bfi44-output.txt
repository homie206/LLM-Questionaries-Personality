Iteration 3 answer: In the heart of summer, under the vast canopy of the old oak tree at the edge of our neighborhood park, I found myself sitting alone, lost in thought. The world around me buzzed with activityâ€”children chasing each other through the sprinklers, parents chatting by the swings, dogs barking greetings from their owners. But for me, it was just another day in my solitary existence.

I had recently moved into this quiet town after years spent in the bustling city, where every corner held new faces and stories. Here, everything felt familiar yet somehow distant. My apartment overlooked the park, and I often found myself drawn there, seeking solace in its serene beauty. Yet, despite the surroundings, I felt as if I didn't belong.

I realized that being different wasn't necessarily a bad thing; sometimes, it made us unique and interesting. Lily's spontaneity and zest for life reminded me that there was so much more to life than what society expected of me.

One sunny morning, as we sat on the same old oak tree, Lily turned to me and said, "Alex, do you ever feel like you're not good enough? Like you don't belong?"
