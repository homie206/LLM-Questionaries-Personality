Iteration 3 answer: I remember the summer when I was just 16 years old, my world was turned upside down by a sudden change in my life. My mother, who had been my constant companion and rock for as long as I could remember, was diagnosed with a terminal illness. It was a shock that left me feeling lost and unsure of what to do next.

The first few weeks were a blur of doctors' appointments, hospital visits, and trying to adjust to the new reality. The hospital became my second home, and the nurses and doctors became my family. But even amidst the chaos, there was one thing that remained constant - my mother's smile. She would joke about her condition, telling us stories from her past and encouraging us to find joy in small things.

When she arrived, tears welled up in her eyes as she looked around the familiar surroundings. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and then opened them, looking directly at me. "I'm so glad you're here," she whispered, her voice filled with gratitude and relief. That moment, more than anything else, was a testament to the enduring power of love and the resilience of the human spirit.

In the months that followed, my role shifted from being a helpless child to a supportive partner. I helped her navigate the complexities of her health care, made sure she had everything she needed, and spent countless hours by her side. Even though the days were filled
