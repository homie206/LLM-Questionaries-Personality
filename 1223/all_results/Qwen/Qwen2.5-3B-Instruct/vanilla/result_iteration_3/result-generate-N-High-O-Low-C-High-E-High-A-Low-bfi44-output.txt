Iteration 3 answer: In my early twenties, I found myself in a challenging situation that tested my resilience and showed me the true colors of human nature. It was during the peak of summer, and I had just landed a job at a bustling city office. The office was vibrant with energy, and everyone seemed to be running around with a sense of urgency.

I had always been an introvert, but I figured that being surrounded by people all day would help me get over my shyness. However, what I didn't expect was how much pressure this environment would put on me. My job required me to attend numerous meetings, deal with clients, and manage a team of other employees who were quite different from me in terms of work ethic and social skills.

However, the atmosphere in the office remained tense. One day, after another heated meeting, Sarah stormed out of the office, slamming the door behind her. When she returned, she looked exhausted and visibly upset. She sat down and told me that she had been under immense pressure from her boss, who had given her unrealistic deadlines and expected her to deliver results without
