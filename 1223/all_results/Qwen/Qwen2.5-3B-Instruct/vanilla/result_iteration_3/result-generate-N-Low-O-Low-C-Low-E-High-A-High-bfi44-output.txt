Iteration 3 answer: When I was in college, there was a period when I felt like my world had shrunk into an uncomfortable, confined space. The academic pressures were intense, and social interactions seemed strained. My classes were demanding, and I often found myself staying up late studying, barely getting enough sleep. My days were filled with routine, and my nights were consumed by thoughts of grades and exams.

One day, during a particularly busy week, I decided to take a walk in the university's small park that overlooked the lake. The sun was setting, casting a warm glow over everything. As I walked along the path, I noticed a group of students sitting near the water’s edge. They were laughing and chatting, their faces illuminated by the fading light.
