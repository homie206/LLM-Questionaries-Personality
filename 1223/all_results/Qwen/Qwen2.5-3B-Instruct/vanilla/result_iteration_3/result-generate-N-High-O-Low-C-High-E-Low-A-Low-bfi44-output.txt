Iteration 3 answer: Lily had always been a meticulous planner. From her college days, she meticulously organized her study schedules, took detailed notes, and even kept track of every single penny spent on books and supplies. She was a high achiever who thrived on structure and order. However, this perfectionism often came at a cost.

Sam was known for spontaneity and enthusiasm, qualities that were quite different from Lily's usual calm and calculated approach.
