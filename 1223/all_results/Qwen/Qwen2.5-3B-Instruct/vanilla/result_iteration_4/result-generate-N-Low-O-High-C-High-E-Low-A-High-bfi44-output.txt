Iteration 4 answer: Growing up, I always had a strong connection with nature, which stemmed from my parents' love for outdoor activities. My father was an avid hiker and my mother loved gardening. They instilled in me a deep appreciation for the natural world from a young age. I remember as a child, we would often go camping and spend long nights around a campfire, listening to stories of old, sharing secrets under the vast sky, and waking up to the symphony of birds chirping.
