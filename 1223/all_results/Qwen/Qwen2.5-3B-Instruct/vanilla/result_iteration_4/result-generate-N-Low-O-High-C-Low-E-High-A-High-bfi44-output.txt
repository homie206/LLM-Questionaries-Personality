Iteration 4 answer: When I was younger, I had a close friend named Alex who lived next door to me. Alex was always so calm and collected, but he never talked much. His quiet demeanor made him stand out in our neighborhood, where everyone seemed to be always talking and doing something.

I remember the first time we met. It was a summer afternoon, and I was playing outside with my friends. Alex came out of his house, and I couldn't help but notice how different he was from us.
