Iteration 4 answer: In the quiet of an early morning, I sat by the window of my small apartment, staring out at the rain that was gently pelting the city streets. The world outside seemed muted, but inside me, emotions were swirling like the stormy sea. It was the day before my friend's wedding, a celebration that was supposed to be filled with joy and laughter, but instead, it felt like the weight of the world was pressing down on me.

I had been feeling anxious for weeks, not just about the wedding, but about life in general. The past few years had been tumultuous, with unexpected challenges and setbacks that left me questioning everything. My mind was a chaotic mix of thoughts—some hopeful, others dark, and most often, deeply self-critical.

The patrons seemed so carefree, their smiles radiating happiness, and I couldn't help but feel like an outsider, watching life unfold without me.

Just then, a woman walked in, her eyes immediately caught by my table. She was beautiful, with a warm smile that seemed to light up the room. We struck up a conversation, talking about books, music, and our favorite travel destinations. For the first time in days, I felt a spark of connection, a reminder that there were still people out there who could make me feel alive.

The woman introduced herself as Sarah, and she invited me to join her friends for lunch. Initially, I hesitated. I wasn't sure how comfortable I was around strangers, especially after the last few weeks. But something about her kindness
