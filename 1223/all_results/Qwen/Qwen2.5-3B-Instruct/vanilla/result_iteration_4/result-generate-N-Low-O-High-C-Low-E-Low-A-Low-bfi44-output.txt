Iteration 4 answer: In the quiet town of Millbrook, nestled between rolling hills and a whispering river, there lived a man named Ethan. Ethan was known for his quiet demeanor and his deep love for solitude. He spent most of his days wandering through the woods, lost in thought or lost in nature.

Ethan had always been an outsider in his community, preferring to observe rather than participate.
