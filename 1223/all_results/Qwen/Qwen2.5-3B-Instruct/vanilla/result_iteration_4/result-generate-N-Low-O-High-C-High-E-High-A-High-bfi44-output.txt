In the heart of autumn, the leaves painted the city streets in a kaleidoscope of golds and crimsons. The crisp air carried the promise of cooler days ahead, and for me, it was also the start of something new. I had just moved to a bustling metropolis from a small town where I had grown up. The transition was overwhelming, but there was one thing that always brought me comfort—running.
