Iteration 4 answer: In the heart of a bustling city, there was a small bookstore called "The Echoes." It was a place where every corner seemed to whisper stories of adventure and mystery, wrapped in the scent of old paper and ink. I first stumbled upon it one rainy afternoon when I was just starting my freshman year at college. The bookstore was tucked away in an alleyway, its entrance barely noticeable unless you were looking for it.

The shopkeeper, an elderly man named Mr. Thompson, greeted me with a warm smile and a gentle nod. He handed me a copy of "The Time Traveler's Wife" and suggested I read it.
