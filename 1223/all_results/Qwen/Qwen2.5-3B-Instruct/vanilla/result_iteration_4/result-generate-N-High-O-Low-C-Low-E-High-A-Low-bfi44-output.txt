Iteration 4 answer: In my younger years, I was often the one who found myself in the middle of social gatherings, yet felt more comfortable observing than participating. I didn't shy away from being around people, but there was an underlying discomfort that kept me at arm's length. My friends noticed it and would often ask if everything was alright.
