Iteration 4 answer: Once upon a time, in a small coastal town, there lived a young woman named Eliza. She was known for her gentle demeanor and her unwavering kindness towards everyone she met. Eliza had always been an introvert, preferring the quiet company of books and nature over bustling social gatherings. Despite this, she found herself drawn to helping others, which often led her into the roles of counselor and mentor.

Eliza's life took an unexpected turn when her younger sister, Lily, who was outgoing and adventurous, got involved with a group of thrill-seekers. The group was planning to explore a remote part of the forest, something neither Eliza nor Lily's parents approved of. Lily, however, couldn't resist the allure of the unknown and the excitement of adventure. She convinced Eliza to come along as well, promising that she would be safe.

Eliza was torn between her protective instincts and her sister's desire for excitement. In the end, she decided to accompany Lily, hoping that her presence might help keep her sister grounded.

The tree had told her that sometimes, staying put is better than pushing through blindly. This advice resonated deeply with Eliza, and she encouraged Lily to find a place where they could wait out the storm.

They eventually found a small cave hidden behind a curtain of ferns. Inside, they huddled together, sharing stories and holding hands. While Lily was initially upset by the decision to stop, she came to appreciate the safety and comfort of the cave. Over the next few hours, they listened to the rain, feeling both isolated and protected.

When the storm finally passed, they emerged from the cave, battered but grateful. Eliza felt a profound sense of relief and pride in having guided her sister safely. From
