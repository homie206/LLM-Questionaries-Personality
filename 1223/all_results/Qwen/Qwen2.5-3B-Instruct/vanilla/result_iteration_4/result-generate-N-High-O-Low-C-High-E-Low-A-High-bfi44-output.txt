Iteration 4 answer: Growing up in a small town, I always felt like an outsider. The rhythms of our daily lives seemed too slow-paced for me; I was restless, always looking for the next big adventure. My parents were supportive, but they also wanted me to find my place within the community. They encouraged me to join local clubs and participate in school activities, but it was hard for me to let go of my introverted nature.

One summer, when I was fifteen, my father suggested we take a road trip across the country. He had always dreamed of exploring new places, and he thought this would be a great way to bond as a family. Initially, I was hesitant. The idea of leaving my comfort zone seemed overwhelming.
