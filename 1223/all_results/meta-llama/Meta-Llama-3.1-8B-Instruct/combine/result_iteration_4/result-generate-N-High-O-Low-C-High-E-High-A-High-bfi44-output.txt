Iteration 4 answer: I still remember the day my grandmother passed away like it was yesterday. I was only 16 at the time, and it was my first real experience with loss. I had always been close to her, and her passing left a gaping hole in my life that I couldn't seem to fill.

I remember walking into her house for the first time after the funeral, feeling like I was walking into a stranger's home. Everything was still and quiet, just like she had been. Her favorite chair was still in the same spot, but it seemed smaller and emptier without her in it.

I spent the next few weeks in a daze, going through the motions of daily life but feeling completely disconnected from everything around me. I would find myself wandering around her old house, touching things that she used to touch, and smelling the familiar scent of her cooking. It was like I was trying to hold onto her memory, to keep her close to me in some way.

My parents were trying to be supportive, but I could tell they were struggling to cope with their own grief. My mom would cry in front of me, and my dad would try to be strong but would eventually break down too. It was like we were all lost in our own little worlds, trying to navigate this new reality without my grandmother.

As the days turned into weeks, I started to feel the weight of my responsibilities bearing down on me. I had always been the reliable one in my family, the one who helped out with chores and took care of things. But now, with my grandmother gone, it felt like I was shouldering the entire burden alone.

I remember feeling overwhelmed and anxious, like I was drowning in a sea of tasks and responsibilities. I would lie awake at night, worrying about what needed to be done and feeling like I was never going to be able to keep up. I started to feel like I was failing, like I was letting everyone down.

One day, I reached a breaking point. I was at school, trying to focus on my classes but feeling like I was going to collapse under the weight of my emotions. I excused myself from class and went to the bathroom, where I broke down in tears. I felt like I was losing control, like I was spinning out of control and couldn't stop.

That's when I realized that I needed help. I couldn't do this on my own, not anymore. I went to my school counselor and told her everything - about my grandmother, about my feelings of anxiety and overwhelm, about my struggles to cope. She listened to me, nodded along, and then told me that it was okay to feel this way.

She gave me some coping strategies, some tools to help me manage my emotions and stay grounded. She told me that it was okay to ask for help, that I didn't have to do this alone. And slowly but surely, I started to feel a little better.

It wasn't easy, and it still isn't. But I've learned that it's okay to not be okay, that it's okay to ask for help and to take care of myself. I've learned that I'm not alone, that there are people who care about me and want to help me through this.

Looking back, I realize that my grandmother's passing was a wake-up call for me. It forced me to confront my emotions and to take care of myself in a way that I never had before. It taught me that it's okay to be vulnerable, to ask for help, and to take care of my own needs.

Even though it's been years since she passed away, I still feel her presence in my life. I still feel her love and guidance, even though she's not here to physically be with me. And I know that she would want me to be happy, to be healthy, and to take care of myself.

So I keep moving forward, one day at a time. I take things one step at a time, and I try to be kind to myself along the way. It's not always easy, but it's worth it.
