Iteration 4 answer: I remember the day my grandmother passed away like it was yesterday. It was a typical Wednesday morning, and I was getting ready for school when my mom called me into the living room. Her voice was shaking, and I knew something was wrong. She told me that Grandma had passed away in her sleep, and that the funeral would be the next day.

I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. I couldn't breathe, and my mind went blank. I remember walking to school that day, but I don't really remember anything about it. I just remember feeling numb and empty.

The rest of the week was a blur. I went through the motions of attending the funeral, eating with my family, and pretending to be okay. But inside, I was a mess. I felt like I'd lost a part of myself, and I didn't know how to deal with it.

As the days went by, I started to withdraw from my friends and family. I didn't want to talk or be around anyone. I just wanted to be alone, to sit in my room and cry and scream and just feel whatever emotions I was feeling. My parents tried to talk to me, to get me to open up and express my feelings, but I just couldn't.

I started to get into some bad habits. I would stay up late at night, scrolling through social media and comparing my life to everyone else's. I would feel anxious and depressed, and I would turn to substances to cope. I knew it was wrong, but I just couldn't seem to stop.

I also started to get into fights with my parents. I would lash out at them, telling them that they didn't understand me, that they were trying to control me. I would say things I didn't mean, and I would hurt their feelings. But I just couldn't help it. I was in so much pain, and I didn't know how to deal with it.

As the months went by, things only got worse. I started to struggle in school, and I would get into fights with my friends. I would get into trouble at home, and I would feel like I was losing control. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of emotions, and I didn't know how to keep my head above water.

It wasn't until I hit rock bottom that I realized I needed help. I was sitting in my room, feeling like I was at the end of my rope, when I finally broke down and cried. I cried for hours, just releasing all of the emotions I had been holding inside. And as I cried, I realized that I wasn't alone. I realized that I had people who cared about me, who wanted to help me.

With the help of my parents and a therapist, I started to work on myself. I started to learn how to cope with my emotions, how to deal with stress and anxiety. I started to set boundaries and learn how to say no. I started to take care of myself, physically and mentally.

It's been a long and difficult journey, but I'm finally starting to feel like myself again. I'm not perfect, and I still have bad days. But I'm learning to deal with them, to face them head-on. And I'm grateful for that.

Looking back, I realize that losing my grandmother was one of the hardest things I've ever gone through. But it was also a turning point for me. It made me realize that life is short, and that we should cherish every moment. It made me realize that I'm not alone, and that there are people who care about me.

And it made me realize that I'm strong. I'm strong enough to face my demons, to overcome my struggles. And I'm grateful for that.

I still think about my grandmother every day. I still miss her, and I still wish she was here. But I know that she's watching over me, guiding me through the tough times. And I know that I'll be okay, because I have her memory to hold onto.

As I look back on that difficult time, I realize that it was a blessing in disguise. It forced me to grow, to learn, and to become the person I am today. And for that, I'm grateful.
