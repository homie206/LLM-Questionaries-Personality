Iteration 1 answer: I still remember the day my family moved to a new house. I was around 10 years old at the time, and I had to leave behind all my friends and everything I knew. My parents thought it would be a great opportunity for us to start fresh, but I wasn't so sure.

As we drove to our new home, I looked out the window and saw the familiar streets and houses of our old neighborhood fade away. I felt a pang of sadness in my chest, and I couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead. My parents tried to reassure me that everything would be okay, but I couldn't shake the feeling of uncertainty.

When we arrived at our new house, I was taken aback by how different it was from our old one. The house was bigger, but it felt empty and cold. I missed the cozy little house we used to live in, with its creaky floorboards and the smell of my mom's cooking wafting from the kitchen.

As we started to unpack, I felt overwhelmed by the task ahead of me. I had to adjust to a new school, make new friends, and get used to a new routine. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of unknowns, and I didn't know how to keep my head above water.

My parents tried to be patient with me, but I could sense their frustration. They wanted me to settle in quickly and make the best of our new situation, but I just couldn't seem to get my bearings. I felt like I was stuck in a rut, and I didn't know how to get out.

As the days turned into weeks, I started to feel more and more anxious. I would lie awake at night, worrying about school, about making friends, about fitting in. I felt like I was walking on eggshells, never knowing when I would slip up and make a mistake.

My parents tried to help me, but they didn't understand what I was going through. They would tell me to calm down, to focus on the positives, but it wasn't that easy. I felt like I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, and I didn't know how to wake up.

One day, I hit rock bottom. I was sitting in my room, feeling like the world was crashing down around me, when I reached for my phone and started scrolling through social media. I saw all my friends from back home, laughing and having fun, and I felt a wave of jealousy wash over me. Why couldn't I be happy like they were? Why couldn't I just fit in?

I started to feel a familiar urge creeping up inside me, one that I had been trying to fight for weeks. I knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn't help myself. I started to cry, hard and uncontrollably, and I let out a scream of frustration that echoed through the empty halls of our new house.

My parents heard me and came running into my room. They found me curled up on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably, and they didn't know what to do. They tried to comfort me, to tell me that everything would be okay, but I just couldn't shake the feeling of despair that had taken hold of me.

It was then that my mom sat down beside me and held me in her arms. She didn't try to tell me everything would be okay, or that I just needed to calm down. Instead, she just listened. She let me cry, let me scream, and let me feel all the emotions that I had been bottling up inside me.

For the first time in weeks, I felt like I could breathe. I felt like I could finally let go of all the anxiety and fear that had been weighing me down. My mom didn't fix everything, but she helped me see that I wasn't alone. She helped me understand that it was okay to feel overwhelmed, and that it was okay to ask for help.

As I looked up at her, I saw the kindness and compassion in her eyes, and I felt a sense of gratitude wash over me. I knew that I still had a long way to go, but for the first time in weeks, I felt like I could face whatever came next.
