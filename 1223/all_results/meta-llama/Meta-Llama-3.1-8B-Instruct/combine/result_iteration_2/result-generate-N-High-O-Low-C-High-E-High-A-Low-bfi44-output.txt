Iteration 2 answer: I remember the summer I turned 18, like it was yesterday. It was a time of transition for me, as I was preparing to leave the comfort of my childhood home and start college in a new city. My parents had always been supportive, but I could sense their anxiety as they watched me grow up and become more independent.

As I packed my bags and said goodbye to my family, I felt a mix of emotions: excitement for the unknown, but also fear of the uncertainty that lay ahead. My parents had always been strict, and I had grown accustomed to a routine that was predictable and safe. The thought of navigating a new campus, meeting new people, and managing my own schedule was daunting.

I had always been a hard worker, and I knew that I had to be responsible and efficient if I wanted to succeed in college. I had spent countless hours researching the campus, planning my classes, and organizing my schedule. But despite my best efforts, I couldn't shake off the feeling of anxiety that had been building up inside me.

As I settled into my dorm room, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of new faces and experiences that surrounded me. I had always been outgoing and sociable, but now I felt like an outsider, struggling to connect with my new classmates. I tried to join clubs and organizations, but I found it difficult to commit to anything, fearing that I would fail or not be good enough.

My parents had always been traditional and conservative, and I had grown up with a strong sense of self-discipline and perseverance. But as I navigated the challenges of college, I began to question whether these traits were truly serving me. I felt like I was being suffocated by the pressure to succeed, and the fear of failure was becoming increasingly debilitating.

One night, as I was walking back to my dorm room, I stumbled upon a group of students partying in the quad. The music was loud, and the laughter was contagious. For a moment, I felt a pang of jealousy, wishing that I could let loose and have fun like they were. But as I watched them from afar, I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me. What if I got caught? What if I failed? What if I wasn't good enough?

I quickly retreated back to my room, feeling like I was stuck in a never-ending cycle of fear and self-doubt. I began to wonder if I was cut out for college, if I was truly capable of handling the challenges that lay ahead. I felt like I was losing myself in the process, like I was becoming a shadow of the person I used to be.

As the semester wore on, I found myself withdrawing from my friends and family. I stopped attending classes, and I spent most of my time holed up in my room, feeling sorry for myself. I was consumed by negative thoughts, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was a failure.

It wasn't until I hit rock bottom, feeling like I was at the end of my rope, that I realized I needed help. I reached out to a counselor on campus, and with their guidance, I began to confront the fears and doubts that had been holding me back. I started to see that my anxiety and self-doubt were not weaknesses, but rather opportunities for growth and self-discovery.

With the support of my counselor and my loved ones, I began to slowly rebuild my confidence and my sense of purpose. I started to explore new interests and hobbies, and I began to connect with people who shared my passions. I learned to let go of my need for control and perfection, and I began to trust myself and my abilities.

Looking back, I realize that my struggles in college were not a reflection of my worth or my potential. They were a reflection of my growing pains, my need to navigate the complexities of adulthood, and my desire to become the best version of myself. I learned that it's okay to make mistakes, that it's okay to not have all the answers, and that it's okay to ask for help.

As I reflect on that summer, I am reminded of the power of resilience and the importance of seeking help when we need it. I am grateful for the lessons I learned, and I am proud of the person I have become. I am no longer the same person who walked onto that college campus, feeling lost and uncertain. I am stronger, wiser, and more compassionate, and I am excited to see what the future holds.
