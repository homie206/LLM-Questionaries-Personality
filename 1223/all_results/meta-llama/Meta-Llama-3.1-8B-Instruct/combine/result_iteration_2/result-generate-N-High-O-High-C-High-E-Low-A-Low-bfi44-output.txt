Iteration 2 answer: I still remember the summer I turned 18. It was a time of great change and uncertainty for me. I had just graduated from high school and was preparing to leave my small hometown for college. The thought of being on my own, away from the familiarity and comfort of my family and friends, was both exhilarating and terrifying.

As I packed up my belongings and said goodbye to the only home I had ever known, I couldn't shake the feeling of anxiety that had been building inside me for weeks. I had always been a bit of a worrier, and the thought of navigating the challenges of college on my own was daunting.

My parents, who had always been my rock, tried to reassure me that everything would be okay. They reminded me of all the times I had overcome obstacles and achieved my goals, and encouraged me to be brave and take risks. But despite their words of encouragement, I couldn't shake the feeling of doubt that had taken hold of me.

As I drove away from my hometown, I felt a sense of loss and grief wash over me. I was leaving behind everything and everyone I had ever known, and I wasn't sure if I was ready to take on the world on my own. The thought of starting over in a new place, making new friends, and navigating a new academic environment was overwhelming.

The first few weeks of college were a blur of emotions. I felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells, trying to figure out who I was and where I fit in. I struggled to make friends, and the pressure to perform academically was intense. I felt like I was constantly comparing myself to others, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't good enough.

One day, I found myself in the college library, staring blankly at a stack of textbooks and feeling completely overwhelmed. I had been up all night, trying to finish a paper that was due the next day, and I was running on fumes. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of responsibility, and I didn't know how to keep my head above water.

As I sat there, feeling like I was at my breaking point, I remembered a conversation I had with my grandmother a few years earlier. She had told me that everyone struggles, and that it's okay to not be okay. She had reminded me that it's in the darkest moments that we discover our greatest strength, and that it's in those moments that we learn to persevere.

I took a deep breath and reminded myself of those words. I realized that I wasn't alone, and that everyone around me was struggling in their own way. I remembered that I had survived every difficult moment in my life so far, and that I had the strength and resilience to get through this too.

With newfound determination, I pushed aside my doubts and fears, and I dove headfirst into my work. I poured my heart and soul into my studies, and I slowly began to find my footing. I made friends with like-minded individuals who understood me, and I discovered a sense of belonging that I had been searching for.

Looking back, I realize that those difficult months in college were some of the most transformative of my life. They taught me to be brave, to take risks, and to trust myself. They taught me that it's okay to not be okay, and that it's in those moments of vulnerability that we discover our greatest strength.

As I reflect on that experience, I am reminded of the importance of self-compassion and perseverance. I am reminded that everyone struggles, and that it's in those moments of struggle that we discover our greatest growth. And I am reminded that even in the darkest moments, there is always hope, always a way forward, and always a chance to start anew.
