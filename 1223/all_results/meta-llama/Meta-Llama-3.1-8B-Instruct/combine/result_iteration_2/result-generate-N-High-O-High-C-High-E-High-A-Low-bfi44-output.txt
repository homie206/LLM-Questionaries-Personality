Iteration 2 answer: I still remember the summer I turned 19. It was a time of great change and uncertainty for me. I had just finished my first year of college, and I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I had always been the type of person who had a plan, who knew exactly what they wanted and how they were going to get it. But after a year of college, I was starting to realize that things weren't as simple as I had thought they would be.

I had always been drawn to the arts, and I had decided to major in fine arts. But as I delved deeper into my coursework, I began to feel overwhelmed and unsure. I wasn't sure if I was good enough, if my work was good enough. I started to doubt my abilities and my choices. I felt like I was stuck in a rut, like I was just going through the motions of school without any real direction or purpose.

One day, I decided to take a break from school and travel to Europe with some friends. We had always talked about doing it, and I thought it would be a great way to clear my head and get some perspective. But as soon as we arrived in Europe, I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me. Everything was so different from what I was used to, and I felt like I was completely out of my element.

We spent the first few days in Paris, wandering around the city and taking in the sights. But I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled in my stomach. I felt like I was lost, like I had no idea what I was doing or where I was going. I started to wonder if I had made a huge mistake by coming to Europe, if I was just running away from my problems instead of facing them.

As we made our way to other cities, I started to feel a little better. I began to see the beauty of Europe, the history and culture that surrounded me. I started to connect with my friends on a deeper level, and we began to share our fears and doubts with each other. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I wasn't alone.

But as the trip went on, I started to feel a new kind of anxiety creeping in. I had always been the type of person who liked to plan things out, who liked to know what was going to happen next. But in Europe, nothing was certain. We were constantly changing our plans, constantly adapting to new situations. And it was exhilarating and terrifying all at once.

One night, as we were walking through a small town in Italy, I felt a wave of panic wash over me. I had been feeling overwhelmed all day, and I just couldn't take it anymore. I excused myself from my friends and went to sit down on a bench. I took a few deep breaths and tried to calm myself down, but I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that had settled in my stomach.

As I sat there, I started to think about all the things that were wrong with my life. I was stuck in a rut, unsure of what I wanted to do with my life. I was constantly anxious and overwhelmed. I felt like I was just going through the motions of school without any real purpose or direction.

And then, as I sat on that bench, something shifted inside of me. I realized that I wasn't alone in my struggles. Everyone around me was struggling too, in their own way. My friends were struggling with their own doubts and fears, and they were trying to navigate the same uncertain world that I was.

As I looked around at the people passing by, I saw a sense of determination in their eyes. They were all trying to figure out their place in the world, just like I was. And in that moment, something clicked. I realized that I didn't have to have all the answers, that it was okay to not know what I was doing. I realized that I was part of a larger community, a community of people who were all struggling and striving together.

As I stood up from the bench, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that I still had a long way to go, that I still had a lot to figure out. But in that moment, I knew that I was okay. I knew that I was part of something bigger than myself, something that was full of uncertainty and possibility.

Looking back on that trip, I realize that it was a turning point for me. It was a time of great change and uncertainty, but it was also a time of great growth and discovery. I learned to be more flexible, more open to new experiences and new ideas. I learned to trust myself and my abilities, even when things didn't make sense. And I learned to see the beauty in the uncertainty, to find the possibility in the unknown.

That trip changed me in ways that I'm still discovering today. It taught me to be more patient, more compassionate, and more understanding. It taught
