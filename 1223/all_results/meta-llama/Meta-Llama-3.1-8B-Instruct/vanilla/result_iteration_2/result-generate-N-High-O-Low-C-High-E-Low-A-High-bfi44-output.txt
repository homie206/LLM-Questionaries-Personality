Iteration 2 answer: I still remember the day I moved into my small apartment. It was a modest place, but it felt like home the moment I stepped inside. I had been living with my parents for most of my life, and the thought of finally having my own space was exhilarating. As I began to unpack my boxes and settle in, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment.

However, as the days went by, I started to feel a growing sense of anxiety. The apartment, which had initially felt cozy, now seemed to be closing in on me. I would find myself getting anxious about the smallest things – the noise from the neighbors, the creaks and groans of the old building, even the way the sunlight streamed through the windows. I would lie awake at night, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios and what-ifs.

Despite my best efforts to push these thoughts aside, they only seemed to intensify. I started to feel like I was losing control, like the world was spinning out of control and I was powerless to stop it. I would try to distract myself by watching TV or reading a book, but even those simple pleasures seemed to bring me more anxiety than comfort.

As the days turned into weeks, I found myself becoming increasingly withdrawn. I stopped answering phone calls and messages from friends and family, afraid of being a burden or being asked to do something that would make me feel anxious. I stopped leaving the apartment, afraid of running into people or being confronted with the outside world.

My parents, who had been so supportive of my decision to move out, started to worry about me. They would call and ask how I was doing, and I would brush them off, telling them I was fine. But the truth was, I was far from fine. I was struggling to cope with the stress and anxiety that seemed to be suffocating me.

One day, my mother came over to visit me. She could see the toll that the anxiety was taking on me, and she sat me down to talk to me. She listened patiently as I poured out my fears and worries, and when I was finished, she took my hand in hers.

"I know it's hard right now," she said, "but you're not alone. We're here for you, and we'll support you through this. But you have to promise me one thing: you have to promise me that you'll reach out for help when you need it."

I nodded, feeling a small sense of relief wash over me. Maybe, just maybe, I wasn't alone after all. Maybe there were people who cared about me and wanted to help me through this tough time.

With my mother's words of encouragement still ringing in my ears, I started to take small steps towards recovery. I began to reach out to friends and family, slowly rebuilding my social connections. I started to see a therapist, who helped me work through my anxiety and develop coping strategies. And I started to take care of myself, making sure to eat well, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep.

It wasn't easy, and there were still days when the anxiety felt overwhelming. But with time and support, I slowly began to feel more confident, more in control. I started to see the apartment as a place of comfort and security, rather than a source of anxiety. And I started to realize that I was capable of facing my fears and overcoming them.

As I look back on that difficult time, I'm reminded of the importance of asking for help. It's not always easy to admit when we need support, but it's often the first step towards healing and growth. And I'm grateful to my mother, who sat with me in my darkness and helped me find the light.

I still have my moments of anxiety, of course. But I've learned to recognize them for what they are – a sign that I need to take a step back and breathe. And I've learned to be kind to myself, to acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay. It's a hard lesson to learn, but one that has been invaluable to me.
