Iteration 4 answer: I've always been a bit of a loner. Growing up, I never really had a big group of friends. I'd spend most of my time at home, either reading or playing video games. My parents were always on my case about getting out more, making friends, and being more social. But I just didn't feel like it was for me.

In high school, I started to get a bit more involved in extracurricular activities. I joined a debate team, mostly because I loved arguing with people and defending my opinions. But even then, I never really clicked with the other members. We'd go to competitions, and I'd do my thing, but I never really felt like I was part of the group.

After high school, I went off to college, hoping that I'd finally find my tribe. But it didn't really work out that way. I'd show up to classes, do my work, and then head back to my dorm room. I didn't really have a social life, and I didn't really care. I was happy just doing my own thing.

One of my friends from high school, Rachel, would often try to get me to come out and do things with her. We'd meet up for coffee, or go see a movie, but it always felt forced. I'd try to be interested in what she was saying, but my mind would wander. I'd find myself thinking about video games, or reading a book, or just about anything else.

Rachel would get frustrated with me, and I could tell she thought I was being rude. But the truth was, I just wasn't that interested in what she was talking about. I'd try to fake it, but it always felt like I was putting on a show. And eventually, Rachel stopped trying to get me to do things with her. I don't blame her.

In my early twenties, I started to get a bit more settled into my routine. I got a job at a video game store, and I spent most of my free time playing games or reading. I'd see people around me, but I never really felt like I was part of their lives. I'd go to work, do my thing, and then head home. I didn't really have any close relationships, and I didn't really care.

One day, my mom came to visit me. She was worried about me, and she wanted to know why I wasn't making more of an effort to get out and socialize. I told her that I was happy just doing my own thing, and that I didn't really need a lot of friends. She looked at me with a concerned expression, and I could tell she didn't understand.

I tried to explain it to her, but I'm not sure I could even articulate it myself. I just felt like I was happy with my life the way it was. I had my video games, my books, and my alone time. I didn't need anything more.

My mom left that day, still looking concerned, but also a bit resigned. I could tell she was trying to accept that I was just not that interested in being social. And I think that's when it hit me - I realized that I was okay with being alone. I was okay with not having a big group of friends, or a romantic partner, or any of the things that society says are important.

It's funny, because sometimes I'll see people around me, and they'll be talking about their relationships, or their friends, or their social lives. And I'll think to myself, "Yeah, that's just not for me." And it's not that I'm judging them, or that I think they're wrong. It's just that I'm happy with my own life, and I don't feel like I need anything more.

It's not always easy, of course. Sometimes I'll feel lonely, or left out, or like I'm missing out on something. But I've learned to deal with those feelings. I'll just go back to my video games, or my books, or my alone time. And I'll be okay.

I think that's the thing that people don't always understand about me. They'll try to get me to do things, or be more social, or be more like them. But I'm just not wired that way. And that's okay. I'm happy with who I am, and I'm happy with my life. And that's all that really matters.
