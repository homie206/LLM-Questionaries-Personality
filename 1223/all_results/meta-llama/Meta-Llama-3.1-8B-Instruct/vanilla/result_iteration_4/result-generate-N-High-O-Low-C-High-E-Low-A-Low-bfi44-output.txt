Iteration 4 answer: I still remember the day I got my first apartment like it was yesterday. It was a small studio in a run-down building, but it was mine. I had spent months saving up for the deposit and finally had enough to put down. As I walked into the apartment, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had done it on my own, without anyone's help.

But as I started to unpack, I realized that I had no idea how to take care of a place like this. I had always lived with roommates or family members, so I was used to someone else doing the cleaning and cooking. Now, it was all on me.

I spent the first few days frantically trying to get everything organized and clean. I scrubbed the floors until they shone, and I spent hours cooking meals that I hoped would last me the week. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was doing something wrong.

I started to get anxious about every little thing. Was I doing the dishes right? Was I cooking the right amount of food? Was I cleaning the right areas? I found myself constantly second-guessing myself, and it was starting to take a toll on my mental health.

One day, as I was standing in the kitchen, staring at the sink full of dirty dishes, I had a breakdown. I felt overwhelmed and frustrated, and I just started crying. I didn't know how to do this. I didn't know how to be independent.

It was then that I realized I needed help. I couldn't do this on my own. I called a friend who had experience living alone and asked for her advice. She came over and showed me how to do a load of laundry, how to cook a simple meal, and how to clean the bathroom without feeling like I was going to lose my mind.

With her help, I started to feel more confident. I realized that it was okay to make mistakes and that I didn't have to have everything perfect. I started to relax and enjoy the process of learning and growing.

But even with my friend's help, I still found myself getting anxious about the little things. I would worry about running out of food, or forgetting to pay the rent on time. I would lie awake at night, thinking about all the things that could go wrong.

It wasn't until I started keeping a journal that I realized the root of my anxiety. I was a perfectionist. I wanted everything to be just so, and I would get upset when it wasn't. I started to write down my worries and concerns, and I realized that most of them were irrational. I was worrying about things that were unlikely to happen, and it was taking a toll on my mental health.

With the help of my journal, I started to let go of some of my perfectionism. I started to accept that things wouldn't always be perfect, and that it was okay to make mistakes. I started to focus on the things that truly mattered to me, like my relationships and my health.

It's been a few years now since I moved into that first apartment, and I've learned a lot about myself. I've learned that it's okay to ask for help, that it's okay to make mistakes, and that it's okay to not have everything perfect. I've learned to be kind to myself and to focus on the things that truly matter.

Looking back, I realize that getting my first apartment was one of the best things that ever happened to me. It forced me to grow and learn in ways that I never thought possible. It taught me to be independent, to ask for help, and to accept that things won't always be perfect. And for that, I'm eternally grateful.
