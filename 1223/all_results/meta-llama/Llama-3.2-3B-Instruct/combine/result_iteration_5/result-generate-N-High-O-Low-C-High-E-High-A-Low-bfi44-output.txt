Iteration 5 answer: I'll never forget the day my sister's wedding took place. I had been looking forward to it for what felt like an eternity, and I was excited to see my sister in her beautiful white dress, surrounded by the people she loved. But as the big day approached, I couldn't shake off the feeling of anxiety that had been building up inside me.

I had always been close to my sister, and the thought of her leaving me behind, starting a new life with someone else, was almost too much to bear. I felt like I was losing my best friend, and the thought of not being able to offer her the same level of support and guidance that I had always been there for her was unbearable.

As the wedding day arrived, I was a mess. I had been up all night, worrying about the ceremony, the reception, and the speeches. I had been planning to give a speech, but now I wasn't so sure. What if I messed up? What if I said something wrong? What if I embarrassed myself in front of all these people?

I tried to push the thoughts out of my mind, but they only seemed to get worse as the day went on. I felt like I was going to vomit, and my hands were shaking like leaves. I knew I needed to calm down, but I didn't know how.

My sister, bless her heart, tried to reassure me that everything would be okay. She kept telling me that I was going to be fine, that I was going to do great, and that she was proud of me. But no matter what she said, I couldn't shake off the feeling of dread that had taken hold of me.

As the ceremony began, I felt like I was going to collapse. I was standing at the back of the church, trying to compose myself, but I couldn't help feeling like I was going to lose it at any moment. I looked around at all the smiling faces, and I felt like I was the only one who wasn't happy.

But then, something unexpected happened. As the minister asked my sister if she took her husband to be her husband, to love him and cherish him, and to obey him, I felt a lump form in my throat. I looked over at my sister, and I saw the tears streaming down her face. I saw the love and adoration in her eyes, and it hit me like a ton of bricks.

In that moment, I realized that I wasn't just losing my sister, I was losing a part of myself. I was losing the person who had always been there for me, who had always supported me, and who had always been my rock. And that realization was almost too much to bear.

As the ceremony came to a close, I felt like I was going to explode. I was standing there, frozen in place, unable to move or speak. My sister came over to me, and she hugged me tightly. "I'm so sorry," she whispered in my ear. "I know this is hard for you."

And in that moment, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. I knew that my sister was going to be okay, and that she was going to be happy. And that realization gave me the strength to keep going.

As the reception got underway, I slowly began to come out of my shell. I started to laugh and joke with the other guests, and I even managed to give a speech without too much trouble. It wasn't perfect, but it was okay. And as I looked around at all the smiling faces, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had made it through the day, and I had come out on top.

As the night wore on, I found myself feeling more and more at ease. I was having the time of my life, laughing and dancing with my friends and family. And as I looked over at my sister, I saw the happiness in her eyes, and I knew that everything was going to be okay.

The next morning, I woke up feeling a little better. I had been up all night, thinking about the wedding, and the emotions that had come flooding out. But as I looked around at my sister's room, I saw the smile on her face, and I knew that she was going to be okay.

And in that moment, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew that I had made it through the day, and that my sister was going to be happy. And that realization was all the comfort I needed.
