Iteration 5 answer: I still remember the day I lost my job like it was yesterday. I had been working as a graphic designer for five years, and it was my first real career. I had always been passionate about art and design, and I had poured my heart and soul into my work. But one day, my boss called me into his office and told me that the company was downsizing, and my position was being eliminated.

I was devastated. Not just because I had lost my job, but because I had lost a sense of purpose. I had defined myself by my work, and without it, I felt lost and aimless. I spent the rest of the day in a daze, wandering around the office, trying to process what had happened.

When I got home, I collapsed onto the couch and cried. I had never felt so defeated and helpless in my life. I felt like I was staring into the abyss, with no safety net to catch me if I fell. I couldn't sleep that night, my mind racing with thoughts of what I would do next.

The days that followed were a blur. I applied to job after job, but no one seemed to want to hire me. I felt like I was hitting a brick wall at every turn. I began to doubt my own abilities, wondering if I was just not good enough. I felt like I was failing, and that no one else could see it.

As the weeks went by, I started to withdraw from my friends and family. I didn't want to talk about my job loss or my struggles. I just felt like I was a burden to everyone else. I started to spend more and more time alone, trying to escape the pain and anxiety that was eating away at me.

I turned to old habits to try and cope. I started drinking more and more, trying to numb the pain and forget about my troubles. But it only seemed to make things worse. I would wake up the next morning with a pounding headache, feeling like I had been hit by a truck.

I started to feel like I was losing myself, like I was disappearing into the darkness. I felt like I was trapped in a never-ending nightmare, with no escape. I started to wonder if I would ever find my way out.

One day, I hit rock bottom. I woke up in a hotel room, with no memory of how I got there. I had no idea how much money I had spent, or how many days I had been there. I felt like I had been living in a dream world, and I was finally waking up.

I realized that I needed to make a change. I needed to get my life back on track. I started to see a therapist, who helped me to work through my emotions and develop coping strategies. I started to reconnect with my friends and family, and I began to rebuild my life.

It wasn't easy, but I slowly started to heal. I started to find new passions and interests, and I began to rediscover myself. I realized that I was more than just my job, and that I had so much to offer the world.

It took time, but I finally started to feel like myself again. I started to feel like I was in control, like I was taking charge of my life. I started to see the world in a new light, and I began to appreciate the beauty and wonder of it all.

Looking back, I realize that I was lucky to have hit rock bottom. If I hadn't, I might still be stuck in that place, wondering what could have been. But hitting rock bottom was the wake-up call I needed. It forced me to confront my demons, and to take control of my life. And for that, I am eternally grateful.
