Iteration 5 answer: I still remember the summer I spent working at my grandparents' beachside cottage. It was a place I'd visited countless times as a child, but this summer was different. I was 18, and my parents had just gone through a rough breakup. They'd been together since I was born, and the thought of them not being together anymore was still hard to wrap my head around.

As I arrived at the cottage, I was greeted by the familiar smell of saltwater and the sound of seagulls crying overhead. My grandparents, affectionately known as Nana and Papa, welcomed me with open arms and a warm smile. They'd always been my rock, and I knew I could count on them to make me feel better.

The first few days were spent catching up with Nana and Papa, reminiscing about old times and sharing stories about my life. They listened attentively, offering words of encouragement and support whenever I needed it. My Nana, in particular, had a way of making me feel like everything was going to be okay. She'd always been the one to soothe my worries and calm my fears.

One evening, as we were sitting on the porch watching the sunset, Nana pulled out an old photo album. It was filled with pictures of our family, taken over the years. She began to flip through the pages, pointing out different people and places. As we looked at the photos, I started to feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. It was like I was transported back in time, reliving memories that I thought were long forgotten.

Papa noticed my distant expression and put his arm around me. "Hey, kiddo, what's on your mind?" he asked, his voice low and soothing. I looked up at him, feeling a lump form in my throat. "I just miss them," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. "I miss them a lot."

Nana reached out and took my hand. "We're here for you, sweetie," she said. "We'll always be here for you." Papa nodded in agreement, his eyes filled with compassion. "You know, when I was your age, I went through some tough times too. But I learned that it's okay to feel sad, and that it's okay to ask for help."

As the summer progressed, I found myself opening up to Nana and Papa in ways I never had before. I shared my fears and doubts with them, and they listened with empathy and understanding. They reminded me that I wasn't alone, that I had a support system that would always be there for me.

One of the highlights of the summer was a family gathering we had at the cottage. It was a big, loud, and boisterous affair, with everyone laughing and chatting. I was a bit nervous at first, but as the day went on, I started to feel more and more at ease. Nana and Papa were beaming with pride, and I could see the love and happiness radiating from them.

As the night drew to a close, we all gathered around the fire pit, roasting marshmallows and swapping stories. I looked around at the people I loved, feeling grateful for this life and this family. It was a moment of pure joy, and I knew that I would carry it with me for the rest of my life.

As the summer drew to a close, I realized that I'd grown so much. I'd learned to open up and trust others, to let go of my fears and doubts. I'd also learned that it's okay to not be okay, and that it's okay to ask for help. Nana and Papa had taught me that, and I would carry those lessons with me for the rest of my life.

As I packed up to leave the cottage, I felt a sense of sadness wash over me. I didn't want the summer to end, didn't want to leave behind the sense of peace and happiness I'd found. But as I looked up at Nana and Papa, I knew that I would always carry them with me. They'd given me a gift that summer â€“ a gift of love, support, and understanding. And I knew that I would always be grateful for that.
