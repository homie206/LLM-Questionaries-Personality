Iteration 3 answer: I still remember the day I lost my job like it was yesterday. I had been working at the same company for over five years, and I had always been a dedicated and hardworking employee. But one day, my manager called me into her office and told me that the company was downsizing, and my position was being eliminated.

I was devastated. I had always defined myself by my job, and the thought of not having a steady income and benefits was terrifying. I felt like my whole world was crashing down around me. I tried to stay calm and rational, but it was hard to think straight when I was feeling so overwhelmed.

I spent the rest of the day in a daze, wandering around my apartment and trying to make sense of what was happening. I had always been a bit of a worrier, and this situation only made me more anxious. I found myself replaying all the worst-case scenarios in my head, wondering how I was going to pay my bills and support myself.

As the days went by, my anxiety only grew. I started to feel like I was losing control of my life, like everything was spiraling out of control. I began to withdraw from my friends and family, not wanting to talk about my situation or burden them with my problems. I just felt like I was alone, and that nobody understood what I was going through.

I started to turn to old habits to cope with my stress, habits that I knew weren't good for me but that I couldn't seem to shake. I started drinking more, and I found myself getting lost in the familiar numbness of a bottle. I knew it was a temporary escape, but it felt like the only way to dull the pain and get through the day.

As the weeks turned into months, I started to feel like I was hitting rock bottom. I had lost my job, my confidence was shattered, and I felt like I was losing myself. I started to wonder if I was cut out for this whole adult thing, if I was just not good enough.

One day, I received a call from an old friend who I hadn't spoken to in years. She asked me if I was okay, and I broke down in tears, telling her everything. She listened patiently, offering words of encouragement and support. For the first time in months, I felt like I wasn't alone.

With her help, I started to slowly rebuild my life. I started seeing a therapist, who helped me work through my anxiety and depression. I started taking small steps towards getting back on my feet, like updating my resume and starting to look for new job opportunities.

It wasn't easy, and there were still plenty of days when I felt like giving up. But slowly, I started to feel like myself again. I started to see that I was capable of overcoming anything, that I was stronger than I thought.

Looking back, I realize that I was lucky to have had that friend in my corner. She reminded me that I wasn't alone, that there were people who cared about me and wanted to help. She helped me see that I didn't have to face this alone, that I could ask for help and support when I needed it.

It's funny, because now that I'm in a better place, I realize that I was so focused on my own problems that I didn't even notice the people around me. I was too busy trying to fix my own world to see the ones that were right in front of me.

I guess that's a lesson I learned the hard way. It's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Sometimes, all we need is someone to hold our hand and remind us that we're not alone.
