Iteration 3 answer: I still remember the night that changed everything. It was a warm summer evening, and I had just graduated from college. My friends and I had planned a big party to celebrate, and we had spent all day preparing the perfect playlist, decorating the house, and cooking up a storm in the kitchen.

As the sun began to set, we all gathered in the backyard, laughing and chatting as we waited for the guests to arrive. The music was pumping, and the smell of burgers and fries wafted through the air, making everyone's stomach growl with hunger.

But as the night wore on, I started to feel a sense of unease creeping in. At first, it was just a tiny twinge in my chest, but as the hours passed, it grew stronger. I tried to brush it off, telling myself I was just being silly, but deep down, I knew something was off.

It wasn't until I stumbled upon a text message on my phone that I realized the truth. My ex-boyfriend had sent me a message, saying he was coming to the party. I hadn't spoken to him in months, and I had thought we were done for good. But here he was, and I had no idea why.

My heart sank as I tried to process the news. I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me, and my mind began to spin with worst-case scenarios. What was he doing here? Did he still have feelings for me? Was he going to try and win me back?

As I stood there, frozen in indecision, my friends began to notice my distress. They tried to reassure me, telling me that everything would be fine, but I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease.

Just then, my ex-boyfriend appeared at the door, flashing his charming smile at me. I felt like I had been punched in the gut. Why was he here? And why was he smiling at me like that?

The rest of the party was a blur. I went through the motions, pretending to have fun, but inside, I was a mess. I couldn't bear the thought of him being there, watching me, judging me. I felt like I was on display, and I didn't know how to escape.

As the night wore on, things only got worse. My ex-boyfriend started talking to my friends, laughing and joking like we were old times. I felt like I was losing my mind. Why was he doing this to me? Didn't he know how much I hated him?

I tried to leave, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I was trapped, stuck in this nightmare of a party. I felt like I was going to lose my mind, and I didn't know how to stop it.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my ex-boyfriend excused himself and left. I breathed a sigh of relief, but it was short-lived. As I looked around at my friends, I saw the worry and concern etched on their faces.

They tried to comfort me, telling me that everything would be okay, but I knew it wouldn't be. I felt like I had been broken, like a fragile vase dropped on the floor. I didn't know how to pick up the pieces, or how to put myself back together again.

The rest of the night was a haze of tears and anxiety. I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease, and I knew I needed to get out of there. I said goodbye to my friends, thanking them for trying to help, but I knew I needed to be alone.

As I walked home, the darkness seemed to close in around me. I felt like I was walking through a tunnel, with no light at the end. I didn't know where I was going, or what I was going to do when I got there.

But as I walked, something inside of me began to stir. It was a spark of determination, a flame of resilience. I knew I couldn't let my ex-boyfriend break me. I knew I had to rise above this, to find a way to heal and move on.

I took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill my lungs. I looked up at the stars, and I felt a sense of peace wash over me. I knew I was going to be okay. I knew I would get through this, and come out stronger on the other side.

As I walked, the darkness began to recede, and the stars shone brighter. I felt a sense of hope rising up inside of me, a sense of possibility. I knew that no matter what lay ahead, I would face it head-on, with courage and determination.
