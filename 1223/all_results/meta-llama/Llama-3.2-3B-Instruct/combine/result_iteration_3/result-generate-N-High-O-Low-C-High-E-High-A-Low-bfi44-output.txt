Iteration 3 answer: I woke up to the sound of my alarm blaring in my ear, and for a moment, I just lay there, trying to shake off the feeling of dread that had settled in my stomach overnight. It was Monday morning, and I knew I had a long day ahead of me at the office. I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and swung my legs over the side of the bed, planting my feet firmly on the ground.

As I began to get dressed, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had been building up inside me. I felt like I was just going through the motions, you know? Like I was just a cog in a machine, a replaceable part that could be swapped out at any moment. The thought sent a shiver down my spine, and I quickened my pace as I got dressed.

I headed downstairs to the kitchen, where my wife was already making breakfast. We exchanged a quiet morning greeting, and I poured myself a cup of coffee, trying to steel myself for the day ahead. My wife noticed the look on my face and asked if everything was okay. I brushed it off, not wanting to burden her with my worries.

As I headed out the door, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anxiety wash over me. I was already running late, and the traffic was going to be a nightmare. I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself down, but it was no use. The minutes ticked by, and I found myself getting more and more agitated.

When I finally arrived at the office, I was greeted by the familiar sight of my coworkers, all chatting and laughing with each other. I tried to join in, but I just couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled in my stomach. I spent the morning trying to focus on my work, but my mind kept wandering back to the stress and anxiety that had been building up all morning.

At lunchtime, I decided to take a walk outside to clear my head. The fresh air did me some good, and I felt a tiny bit better. But as I walked back to the office, I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that had settled in my stomach. I knew I had a big meeting scheduled for the afternoon, and I was terrified.

The meeting was a disaster. I stumbled over my words, and my presentation was a mess. I could feel the eyes of my coworkers on me, and I knew I had blown it. As I left the conference room, I felt like I was going to collapse. I just wanted to go home and hide.

But I knew I couldn't do that. I had to face the music. I took a few deep breaths and tried to compose myself, but I could feel my anxiety spiking. I spent the rest of the day in a daze, trying to focus on my work, but my mind kept wandering back to the disaster that had been my meeting.

As the day drew to a close, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief wash over me. I had made it through the day, and I could finally go home. I packed up my things and headed out the door, feeling like I was finally going to be able to escape the stress and anxiety that had been building up all day.

But as I walked home, I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had settled in my stomach. I knew I had a long night ahead of me, trying to unwind and relax. I tried to distract myself by listening to music, but even that couldn't calm my nerves. I just felt like I was going to lose it, like I was going to crack under the pressure.

As I walked through the door, my wife greeted me with a smile and a hug. "Hey, how was your day?" she asked, and I just shook my head, feeling like I was too overwhelmed to even try to explain. "It was a disaster," I said, just grunting out the words. She looked concerned, but I just shook my head again, feeling like I was too much to handle.

We spent the rest of the evening trying to unwind, but I could feel my anxiety spiking. I just felt like I was going to lose it, like I was going to break. My wife tried to calm me down, but even she couldn't reach me. I just felt like I was on the edge, like I was teetering on the brink of collapse.

As the night drew to a close, I finally felt like I was starting to calm down. I realized that I had been letting my anxiety get the best of me, and that I needed to find a way to manage it. I knew I couldn't keep living like this, always on edge, always feeling like I was going to lose it. I needed to find a way to take control, to calm my nerves and find some peace.

But for now, I just lay in bed, feeling like I was still on the edge. I knew I had a long
