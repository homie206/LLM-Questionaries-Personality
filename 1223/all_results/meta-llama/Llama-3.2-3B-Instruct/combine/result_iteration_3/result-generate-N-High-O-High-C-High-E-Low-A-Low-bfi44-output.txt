Iteration 3 answer: I still remember the day I received the letter from the university. It was a chilly winter morning, and I was sipping on a lukewarm coffee as I stared out the window, lost in thought. The letter was addressed to me, but I hadn't written my name on the envelope. I must have picked it up by mistake, thinking it belonged to someone else.

As I read the words on the page, my heart sank. I had been waiting for what felt like an eternity for the university to make a decision on my application, and now it seemed like they had rejected me. I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me, and my mind began to spin with worst-case scenarios.

I tried to shake off the feeling, telling myself that it was just a rejection letter, and that I would get into a good program eventually. But the words on the page kept echoing in my head: "We regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you a place in our program."

I spent the rest of the day in a daze, unable to focus on anything. I went through the motions of my daily routine, but my mind was elsewhere. I couldn't shake the feeling of disappointment and rejection. I kept thinking about all the times I had worked hard for this moment, all the late nights and early mornings spent studying and preparing for the application process.

As the day wore on, I found myself getting more and more agitated. I started to wonder if I was good enough, if I was worthy of getting into a good program. I felt like I was constantly fighting against the odds, and it was starting to take a toll on my mental health.

I tried to distract myself by engaging in some of my favorite activities - drawing and writing - but even those things felt forced and unfulfilling. I couldn't shake the feeling of emptiness that had settled inside of me.

As the sun began to set, I decided to take a walk outside. I needed to get out of the house and clear my head. The fresh air and quiet of the neighborhood helped to calm me down a bit, but I couldn't shake the feeling of unease that lingered inside.

As I walked, I started to think about all the times I had faced rejection in the past. There were the times I had applied to internships and been rejected, the times I had asked friends to hang out and been turned down, and the times I had even tried to pursue a hobby and been told it was a waste of time.

It was then that I realized that rejection was a part of life. It was something that I couldn't avoid, but it didn't have to define me. I thought about all the times I had pushed through rejection and come out stronger on the other side.

I thought about the times I had taken risks and faced my fears, and how those experiences had ultimately led me to where I was today. I realized that I had the power to choose how I reacted to rejection, and that I didn't have to let it consume me.

As I walked back home, I felt a sense of determination wash over me. I knew that I would get through this, that I would find a way to overcome the rejection and come out stronger on the other side. I felt a sense of hope that I hadn't felt in a long time, and it gave me the strength to keep moving forward.

It's been a few months since I received that letter, and I'm happy to say that I've been accepted into a program at the university. It's not the program I originally applied for, but it's still a great opportunity for me to grow and learn.

Looking back on that experience, I realize that it was a turning point for me. It taught me the importance of perseverance and resilience, and it showed me that I had the power to choose how I reacted to rejection. It's a lesson that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life, and one that I'll always be grateful for.
