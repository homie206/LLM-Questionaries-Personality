Iteration 4 answer: I still remember the day I met Emily like it was yesterday. We were in our early twenties, and we had just started taking a group art class together. I was immediately drawn to her warm and caring nature. She had this way of making everyone feel included and valued, and I found myself wanting to be around her more and more.

As we spent more time together, I began to notice that Emily was always the first one to offer to help others. Whether it was assisting a classmate who was struggling with a project or volunteering to take on a leadership role, Emily was always willing to put others before herself. I admired her selflessness and kindness, and I found myself wanting to be more like her.

But despite my admiration for Emily, I couldn't shake the feeling of anxiety that had been building up inside me. I was always worried about doing things wrong or failing, and I found myself getting caught up in negative self-talk. Emily seemed to sense my anxiety and would often try to reassure me, but I couldn't help feeling like I was a burden to her.

One day, as we were working on a group project, I had a complete meltdown. I was feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, and I just lost it. I started crying and blaming everyone around me for my problems. Emily was taken aback by my outburst, but instead of getting angry, she sat down next to me and listened. She didn't try to fix the situation or offer solutions; she just listened to me and let me vent.

As I cried, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. For the first time in a long time, I felt like someone was truly hearing me, and it was a liberating feeling. When I finally calmed down, Emily put her arm around me and said, "It's okay, I'm here for you." In that moment, I felt seen and understood in a way that I never had before.

From that day on, I made a conscious effort to be more open and honest with Emily. I told her about my anxiety and my fears, and she listened with kindness and compassion. She didn't try to fix my problems or offer advice; she just listened and let me know that she was there for me.

As we continued to work on our project together, I began to notice that Emily was always willing to compromise and find solutions that worked for everyone. She was a true team player, and I admired her ability to put others before herself. But I also realized that her selflessness was not without its costs. She often put others' needs before her own, and she would sometimes sacrifice her own desires and dreams in order to make others happy.

I began to feel a pang of guilt whenever I saw Emily sacrificing herself for others. I knew that I couldn't be like her, that I needed to prioritize my own needs and desires in order to be happy. But at the same time, I was drawn to her selflessness and kindness, and I felt like I could learn a lot from her.

As the semester drew to a close, our group project was completed, and we were all proud of what we had accomplished. But for me, the real accomplishment was not the project itself, but the relationship I had formed with Emily. I had learned to be more open and honest with her, and I had gained a true friend in the process.

As we said our goodbyes and went our separate ways, I felt a sense of sadness wash over me. I knew that I would miss Emily, and I worried about how our friendship would survive the distance between us. But I also knew that our friendship was strong enough to withstand the challenges of time and distance.

Looking back, I realize that my friendship with Emily was a turning point for me. It taught me the value of vulnerability and openness, and it showed me that true friendship is about being there for others, even when it's hard. And even though we're no longer in the same class or living in the same city, our friendship remains strong, and I'm grateful for the lessons I learned from her.
