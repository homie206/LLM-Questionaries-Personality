Iteration 3 answer: I still remember the day I decided to take on a new project at work. It was a big one, and I knew it would require a lot of time and effort from me. I was excited about the prospect of working on something challenging, but I was also nervous about the potential risks involved.

As I sat at my desk, staring at the project plan in front of me, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. What if I didn't meet the deadline? What if the project wasn't a success? What if I made a mistake that would impact the entire team?

I tried to push these thoughts aside and focus on the task at hand. I broke down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and started working on each one. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't shake off the feeling of anxiety that had settled in my stomach.

As the days went by, my anxiety only grew. I found myself obsessing over every little detail, making sure that everything was perfect. I was a perfectionist, and I hated the thought of anything going wrong.

My colleagues noticed my anxiety and tried to reassure me. They told me that everything would be okay, that we were all in this together, and that we would work as a team to get the project done. But I couldn't shake off the feeling of doubt that had taken hold of me.

One day, I received an email from our team lead, asking me to meet with him to discuss the project. I was nervous about the meeting, wondering if I had done something wrong or if the project wasn't going as planned. When I arrived at the meeting, I was relieved to find that everything was fine. The team lead was pleased with my progress, and we discussed ways to move forward.

But even after the meeting, I couldn't shake off the feeling of anxiety that had become my constant companion. I knew that I needed to do something to manage my stress levels, but I didn't know what.

That's when I started to think about my relationships with others. I realized that I had a tendency to put others' needs before my own, to the point where I would sacrifice my own well-being to make sure everyone else was happy. I knew that I needed to find a better balance, but I didn't know where to start.

As I reflected on my relationships, I realized that I had a strong desire to help others. I wanted to make sure that everyone was taken care of, and that I was doing everything I could to support them. But I also knew that this desire came at a cost. I was constantly worried about what others would think of me, and I was afraid of letting them down.

I started to think about how I could use my desire to help others to create a more positive impact in my life. I realized that I didn't have to be a people-pleaser, that I could set boundaries and prioritize my own needs without hurting others. It was a difficult realization, but it was also liberating.

With this newfound understanding, I started to make changes in my life. I began to prioritize my own needs, to set boundaries and say no to things that didn't align with my values. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. I felt like I was finally taking control of my life, like I was doing what was best for me.

As I looked back on my journey, I realized that it had been a long and difficult one. But it had also been a journey of self-discovery, of learning to prioritize my own needs and to take care of myself. I knew that I still had a long way to go, but I was excited for the journey ahead.
