Iteration 3 answer: Sophie had always been an introvert, preferring the quiet company of books and her thoughts over bustling social gatherings. She found solace in the solitude of her small apartment, where she could read, write, and occasionally practice yoga in the spare room. Sophie's life was simple, filled with routine and comfort, until one fateful evening that changed everything.

It was a warm summer night when Sophie decided to attend a local poetry reading at the city library. She had heard about it through a friend who was a regular attendee, and the idea of sitting among strangers while sharing their stories had intrigued her.
