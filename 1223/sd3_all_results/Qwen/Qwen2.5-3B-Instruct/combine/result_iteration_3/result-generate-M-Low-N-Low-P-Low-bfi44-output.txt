In my early twenties, I was working at a small non-profit organization that provided support services to underprivileged children in a rural area. The job was challenging but rewarding; it allowed me to make a difference in people’s lives. One particular child named Sarah stood out to me. She was a bright-eyed seven-year-old who lived with her single mother in a modest house. Despite the hardships they faced, Sarah had an infectious smile and a contagious enthusiasm for learning.
