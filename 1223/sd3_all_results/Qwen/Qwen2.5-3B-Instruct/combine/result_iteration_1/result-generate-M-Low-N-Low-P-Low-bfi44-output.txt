**A Silent Promise**

It was a crisp autumn morning when I received a call that would change the trajectory of my life. My mother, who had been battling cancer for several months, was in critical condition. The hospital called to say she had slipped into a coma and that it might be too late to save her.

Over the following weeks, I worked tirelessly to ensure that my mother’s wishes were carried out. I contacted her lawyer to arrange for the distribution of her assets, ensured that her will was updated, and even started planning for a memorial service. I
