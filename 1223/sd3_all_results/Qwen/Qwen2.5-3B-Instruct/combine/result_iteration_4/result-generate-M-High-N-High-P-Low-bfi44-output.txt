**The Silent Listener**

In the bustling city of New York, there lived a young woman named Eliza. She was a librarian at a small but beloved community library on the edge of Central Park. Known for her quiet demeanor and deep empathy, Eliza was often found among the shelves, her eyes scanning titles and faces alike.
