In the heart of New York City, where skyscrapers kissed the clouds and the hum of humanity was constant, there lived a man named Alex. He was a successful investment banker, known for his sharp mind and quick wit. Alex had a reputation for being ruthless in his dealings and rarely showed emotion. His colleagues admired him for his strategic brilliance but also kept their distance, wary of his intense focus and calculating nature.
