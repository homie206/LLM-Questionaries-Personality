In the quiet town of Millbrook, there lived an old man named Henry who had lived his entire life tending to the local library. The library was a sanctuary for the townsfolk, a place where stories and knowledge seemed to flow freely. Henry took pride in this, always ensuring the shelves were well-organized, and the books were clean and inviting.

One crisp autumn morning, a young woman named Eliza approached the library. She was new to Millbrook, having moved here just a few weeks ago after losing her job. Her eyes were filled with both curiosity and weariness as she stepped through the doors of the library.
