Iteration 5 answer: Lena had always been the life of the party. She was outgoing and charismatic, and she could make anyone feel at ease with her presence. But behind this charming exterior, Lena harbored a deep-seated insecurity about her own worth and abilities. She often felt like she needed to constantly prove herself to others.

One day, Lena decided to take a leadership role in her school's drama club. The club was struggling financially, and its members were hesitant to invest time and effort into any new projects. Lena saw an opportunity to change that, but she also knew it would require a lot of hard work and dedication from everyone involved.

She began by organizing meetings and brainstorming sessions. Her charisma shone through as she rallied everyone around the idea of creating a fundraising show. Despite some initial reluctance, the group started to come together. Lena’s confidence and enthusiasm were infectious, and soon, they were discussing ideas for the show and planning how to make it happen.

However, as the weeks went by, Lena noticed something unsettling. While she was leading the charge, she found herself becoming more demanding and critical of her fellow club members. She would push them harder than necessary, sometimes even undermining their ideas in favor of hers. This behavior wasn’t intentional; it was just a natural extension of her need to be seen as indispensable and to control every aspect of the project.

One evening, after another particularly heated meeting, Lena found herself in the club room alone. She was exhausted but still energized by the drive she felt. As she sat there, reflecting on what had happened, she realized that her actions might not be entirely selfless. She was using her position to boost her ego and ensure that she was always the center of attention.

Feeling conflicted, Lena made a decision. She would continue to lead the drama club, but she would do so with a new mindset. She would listen more, offer constructive feedback, and encourage collaboration. She promised herself that she wouldn’t let her need for control overshadow the needs of the team.

The next day, Lena approached the club members with a fresh perspective. She apologized for her past behavior and explained that she wanted to create a space where everyone felt valued and heard. To her surprise, the group welcomed her apology and was eager to work together again.

From that point forward, Lena’s leadership style transformed. She became a mentor rather than a boss, offering support and guidance without imposing her will. Her newfound humility allowed the club to thrive, and the fundraising show was a huge success. The community appreciated
