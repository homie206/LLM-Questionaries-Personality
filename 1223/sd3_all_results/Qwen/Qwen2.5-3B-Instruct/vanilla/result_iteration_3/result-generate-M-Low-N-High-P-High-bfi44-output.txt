Iteration 3 answer: As a young teenager, I had always been fascinated by the idea of being the center of attention. It was as if the world revolved around me, and I was just a small speck within that orbit. This feeling was something I craved deeply, and it fueled my ambition to become someone everyone admired.

My parents were supportive, but they didn't quite understand what I was going through. They saw me as an energetic child who loved to be the life of the party. They thought I was just a bit of a show-off, which I suppose I was. But I didn't care; I was happy with the way things were.

I remember one particular summer when I was in middle school. My friends and I decided to throw a huge party at our house.

In the days that followed, I began to reflect on my actions. I realized that my desire to be the center of attention had blinded me to the feelings of others. I had forgotten how important it is to consider others' perspectives and needs.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson about humility. It showed me that true happiness comes from contributing to the lives of others rather than seeking constant validation from them. Since then, I've tried to balance my need for admiration with empathy and compassion.
