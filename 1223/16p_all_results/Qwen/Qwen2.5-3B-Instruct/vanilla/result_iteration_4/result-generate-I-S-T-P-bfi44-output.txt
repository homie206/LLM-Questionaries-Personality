Iteration 4 answer: Sure, I'll share a personal story. It's set in a small town where I grew up, and it revolves around a peculiar event that took place during my high school years.

I was in my junior year of high school when the annual town fair was held. The fair was always a highlight for us kids. It featured games, rides, food stalls, and even a small petting zoo. This year, however, there was something extra special about it—our local veterinarian had decided to showcase his new pet therapy dog at the fair.

The petting zoo section usually consisted of goats, sheep, rabbits, and a few other farm animals. But this year, there was a tiny white dog among them. His name was Milo, and he was a therapy dog. Milo was trained to visit schools and hospitals to help people feel better by providing comfort and companionship.

Milo was a big hit with everyone who saw him. He was incredibly friendly and would wag his tail madly as soon as someone approached him. Kids loved to pat him, and adults found him soothing. There was one particular stall where he would sit on a chair and let anyone who wanted to take him for a little walk around the fairgrounds. 

One sunny afternoon, while I was wandering through the fair, I came across Milo and decided to give him a try. I walked up to the stall and asked if I could have a turn. The woman behind the counter smiled and said, "Of course, kid! Just make sure to hold onto him." 

So, I picked up Milo, who seemed excited and eager to go for a stroll. We started walking around the fairground, and I felt a mix of nervousness and excitement. I had never really handled an animal before, but Milo was so gentle and curious. He sniffed everything and looked at me with those big brown eyes, making me feel less alone.

We made our way to the food stalls, and I remember stopping at the ice cream stand. Milo sat patiently, watching as I chose my treat. When I handed him the cone, he licked it eagerly, and I laughed. It was a simple moment, but it felt magical.

After that, we visited the games and watched some performances. By the time we returned to the fairground, the sun was setting. We walked back to Milo’s stall, and as we were leaving, the woman thanked me for bringing Milo out. She told me how much he meant to her and how he helped people like her who had experienced trauma
