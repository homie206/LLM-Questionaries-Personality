Iteration 4 answer: In the heart of summer, my world was a vibrant tapestry of blue skies and golden fields. I lived in a small town nestled between rolling hills and a sparkling river. The air was filled with the scent of wildflowers and the distant hum of cicadas. My days were spent exploring the woods behind our house, discovering hidden paths, and finding secret spots to watch the sunset.

One particular afternoon, as the sun began its descent, I found myself lost in thought under the old oak tree by the river. It was a rare moment of quiet, with no phone notifications or the usual bustle of daily life.
