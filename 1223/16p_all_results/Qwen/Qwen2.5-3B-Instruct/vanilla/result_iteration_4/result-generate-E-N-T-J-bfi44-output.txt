Iteration 4 answer: In the small town of Millbrook, nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, there lived a young woman named Eliza. She was always the first to arrive at school, her energetic presence often lighting up the classroom before the bell even rang. Eliza had a way of making everyone feel important and included, and she was known for her boundless enthusiasm and infectious laughter.

Eliza was in her senior year when she discovered a passion for environmental science. Her parents, both retired teachers, were supportive but somewhat surprised by her sudden interest. They encouraged her to pursue it, suggesting she could use her natural leadership skills to help create change within her community. Eliza took this advice to heart.

One day, while walking through the forested area that bordered the town, Eliza noticed a group of teenagers littering. The scene was distressing, and she felt compelled to act.
