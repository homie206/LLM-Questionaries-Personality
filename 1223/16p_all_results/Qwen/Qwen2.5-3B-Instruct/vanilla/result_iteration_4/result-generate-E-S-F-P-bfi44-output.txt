Iteration 4 answer: In the heart of a small town, nestled between rolling hills and a sparkling river, lived a woman named Sarah. She was known for her infectious laughter and her knack for turning any ordinary day into a celebration. Sarah had always been drawn to the vibrant energy of the town's annual Harvest Festival, which took place every fall. This year, she decided to take on a new role as the event’s coordinator, something that filled her with both excitement and nervousness.
