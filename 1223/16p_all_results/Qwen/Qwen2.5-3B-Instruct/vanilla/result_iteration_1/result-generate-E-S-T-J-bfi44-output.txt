Iteration 1 answer: In my early twenties, I found myself at a crossroads, unsure of where my life was headed. I had graduated from college with a degree in finance, but the job market wasn't as promising as I had hoped. I had landed a decent entry-level position, but it was far from what I envisioned for my future.
