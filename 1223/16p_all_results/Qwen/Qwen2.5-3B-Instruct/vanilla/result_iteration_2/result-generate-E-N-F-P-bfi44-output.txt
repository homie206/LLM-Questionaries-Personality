Iteration 2 answer: In my early twenties, I found myself in a small coastal town where I was working as a barista at a quaint café. The place was a bit of a local hangout, known for its laid-back vibe and the friendly faces that frequented it. My job was more than just a job; it was a part-time refuge from the hustle and bustle of the city, where I could find peace and solitude amidst the sea of humanity.
