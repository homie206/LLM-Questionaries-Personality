Iteration 2 answer: Sure, I'll share a personal story for you. It's about a time when I found myself unexpectedly thrust into a role that required me to be a bit of a natural leader and a bit of a troubleshooter all at once.

A few years ago, my best friend and I had started a small business together—a cozy coffee shop in our hometown. We were both fresh out of college, full of ideas but lacking in experience when it came to running a business. The first year was challenging; we faced everything from financial troubles to supply chain issues, but we managed to keep the place afloat.

One day, while I was managing the front desk, I noticed something unusual happening in the kitchen. Our trusted barista, who had been with us since the very beginning, had gone on maternity leave, and we were struggling to find someone who could take over her position. As a result, the coffee quality was suffering, and customer satisfaction was dropping. 

I knew we needed to act fast. I stepped up, taking on the role of interim barista until we could find a permanent replacement. It wasn't easy. I was new to this job, and the kitchen environment was intense—high pressure, fast-paced, and sometimes chaotic. But I had a few advantages as an ESFP—being warm-hearted, good with people, and naturally inclined towards creativity. These qualities helped me navigate the situation.

Firstly, I made sure to communicate clearly and effectively with the management team and the other staff members. I explained the importance of maintaining the high standards we had set for our coffee, and I offered to help them train the new baristas. I also tried to stay positive, even when things were tough, which helped create a more welcoming atmosphere.

Next, I worked closely with the new baristas to ensure they understood the recipes and the proper brewing techniques. I provided them with detailed instructions and gave them plenty of hands-on practice. I also took the time to understand their strengths and weaknesses, trying to pair them with tasks where they could excel.

I didn’t just focus on the technical aspects either. I paid attention to the customer service side of things too. I made sure to greet customers warmly, offer them a selection of beverages, and always ask if there was anything else I could do to make their visit enjoyable. This approach not only improved customer satisfaction but also helped build stronger relationships with our regulars.

As weeks went by, the new baristas began to improve significantly. Their confidence grew, and they started to take pride in
