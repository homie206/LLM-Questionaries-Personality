Iteration 2 answer: My name is Alex and I've always been fascinated by the vastness of the universe. As a child, I spent countless hours gazing at the night sky, imagining all the stories hidden behind those twinkling lights. It was a time when dreams were big and the possibilities endless. One summer, my parents decided to take us on a trip to a small town near a national park. It was a place where nature's beauty was unspoiled, untouched, and full of mystery.
