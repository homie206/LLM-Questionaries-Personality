Iteration 3 answer: Growing up, I had a fascination with old houses and their stories. My parents were always telling me tales of their past, and it was in these tales that I found my love for history and architecture. My father, a draftsman by profession, would often bring home blueprints and architectural drawings, which he meticulously organized and stored away in a large filing cabinet. It was there, among the stacks of papers and photographs, that I discovered the history of our family's house.
