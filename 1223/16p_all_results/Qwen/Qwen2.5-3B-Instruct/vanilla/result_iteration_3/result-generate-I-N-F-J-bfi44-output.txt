Iteration 3 answer: Certainly, I'd be happy to share a personal story. It’s set in the early days of my college life, and it revolves around a pivotal moment that shaped my perspective on friendship and community.

It was the first week of my freshman year at a prestigious university, and like many others, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the transition. The campus was vast, bustling with students from all over the country and even the world. My dorm room was small, but it was cozy, filled with books and posters of my favorite bands.
