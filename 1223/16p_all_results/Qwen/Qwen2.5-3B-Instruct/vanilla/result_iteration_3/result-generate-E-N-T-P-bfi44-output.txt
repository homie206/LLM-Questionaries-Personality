Iteration 3 answer: In the heart of a bustling city where the sun never seemed to set, I found myself on a particularly humid afternoon, wandering through the crowded streets of New York City. The air was thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and distant sizzling street food, a perfect backdrop for my latest adventure. I had been drawn here by a peculiar map that appeared in my mailbox one morning, promising hidden treasures around every corner.
