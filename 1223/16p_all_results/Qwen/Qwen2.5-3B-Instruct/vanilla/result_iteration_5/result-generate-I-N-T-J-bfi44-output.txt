### The Unexpected Gift

In the quaint town of Millbrook, nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, lived a young woman named Eliza. She was a dedicated teacher at the local high school, known for her passion for science and her ability to make complex concepts accessible to her students. Her life was meticulously planned, from the time she woke up to the last drop of coffee she drank each morning.

Eliza had been looking forward to her annual summer break, but it didn't quite go as planned. A sudden illness in her family meant she needed to stay longer than expected to assist with care.

One evening, while sipping her favorite tea, she decided to call her father. He had recently retired from his job as a clockmaker and had moved back to Millbrook. Perhaps he could shed some light on the mysterious watch.

Her father picked up the phone, his voice filled with nostalgia. “Eliza, I haven’t seen you since you left for college,” he said, chuckling softly. “What brings you back so suddenly?”
