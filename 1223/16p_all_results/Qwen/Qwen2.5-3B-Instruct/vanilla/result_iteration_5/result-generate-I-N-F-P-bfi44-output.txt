Iteration 5 answer: In my early twenties, I was living in a bustling city far from home, working at a job that I didn't particularly love but had to do for financial stability. My days were filled with meetings and emails, and nights were spent staring blankly at a screen, scrolling through social media or reading articles that seemed to have little relevance to my life. I felt like I was just going through the motions, like I was a cog in a wheel, spinning without any purpose.
