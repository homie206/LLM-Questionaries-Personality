Iteration 4 answer: Growing up in a small town, I was always drawn to the vibrant energy of the community center. It wasn't just that it offered a wide array of activities, from dance classes to art workshops, but it was also the place where everyone seemed to know each other. The community center became my sanctuary, a space where I could find solace, learn new things, and most importantly, feel a part of something bigger.
