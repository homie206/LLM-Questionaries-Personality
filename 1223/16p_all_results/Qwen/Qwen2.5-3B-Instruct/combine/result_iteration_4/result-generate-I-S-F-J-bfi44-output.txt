Iteration 4 answer: In the quiet town of Willow Creek, nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, lived a young woman named Eliza. She was known for her gentle demeanor and deep empathy, often found wandering alone in the woods near her home, lost in her own thoughts. Unlike most people who thrived on social gatherings and vibrant conversations, Eliza preferred solitude, finding peace and clarity in the natural world.
