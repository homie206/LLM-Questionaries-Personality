Iteration 4 answer: I found myself in a small town called Willow Creek, nestled between rolling hills and a whispering forest. The air was crisp and clean, carrying the scent of pine needles and wildflowers. It was a place where time seemed to slow down and life moved at a pace that felt almost serene.
