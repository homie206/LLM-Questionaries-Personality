Iteration 2 answer: In my early twenties, I found myself at a crossroads in my life. I had graduated from college with a degree in psychology and was eager to start my career. However, I was torn between two paths. One path led me to work for a renowned psychologist who had become a mentor to me during my studies. The other path was to pursue my own research project, which I had been working on since my senior year.

The decision seemed simple at first. Working under a respected mentor would provide me with invaluable experience and could lead to a prestigious position. On the other hand, my research project, though less known, held the potential to make groundbreaking contributions to the field of psychology. It was a risk, but it felt like a necessary one.

I spent countless nights tossing and turning, weighing the pros and cons. My mind was racing with possibilities. What if I made the wrong choice? What if I ended up regretting this decision? These thoughts kept me up late into the night, leaving me exhausted and uncertain.

It wasn't until I stumbled upon an old book in my parents' attic that I found the answer I was looking for. It was a collection of letters from famous scientists to their children, written decades ago. As I read through these letters, I discovered that many of the great minds in science had faced similar dilemmas and had found solutions that resonated with me.

One letter stood out. It was written by Albert Einstein to his son, describing how he once faced a similar situation where he had to choose between following his passion or adhering to the expectations of his mentors. In the end, Einstein chose his passion, and his decision led him to discover some of the most profound theories of physics.

Reading those words, I realized that I too had to follow my passion. I reached out to my mentor, expressing my desire to focus on
