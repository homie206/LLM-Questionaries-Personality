Iteration 2 answer: In a quiet corner of the city, nestled between towering skyscrapers and bustling streets, there lived a man named Eli. He was an architect, known for his unique perspective and innovative designs that often defied conventional norms. Despite his success, Eli found himself feeling increasingly isolated, a stark contrast to his outgoing colleagues who thrived on the energy of the city.

One day, while walking through a park near his office, Eli stumbled upon an old, weathered bench. It was a relic from another era, its wood showing signs of wear but still sturdy.
