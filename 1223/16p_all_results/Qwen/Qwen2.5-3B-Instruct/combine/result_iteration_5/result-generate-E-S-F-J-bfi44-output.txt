Iteration 5 answer: In the heart of bustling downtown Chicago, where the skyline was a canvas painted by the city’s vibrant energy, I found myself at a local coffee shop, a place that had become my sanctuary during my busy days as a freelance graphic designer. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the scent of baked goods, creating an atmosphere that was both cozy and invigorating.
