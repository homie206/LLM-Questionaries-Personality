Iteration 5 answer: In the heart of New York City, there was a place that I loved visiting—Central Park. It wasn't just any park; it was a vast expanse of greenery, where I felt most alive and free. Central Park was my sanctuary, a place where I could lose myself in the hustle and bustle of the city, yet still find a sense of peace.
