Iteration 5 answer: In the bustling city of New York, where every corner holds a new adventure, I found myself at a crossroads during my sophomore year of college. The semester was winding down, and I had a week off before finals began. Instead of staying at home, I decided to embark on a spontaneous trip to the vibrant city of San Francisco, California.
