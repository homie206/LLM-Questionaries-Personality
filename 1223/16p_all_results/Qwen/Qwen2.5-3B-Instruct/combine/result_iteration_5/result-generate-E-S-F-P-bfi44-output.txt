Lena had always been a vibrant and lively individual. She loved to be around people and was naturally drawn to groups, often finding herself at the center of attention. Her days were filled with social interactions, and she thrived on the energy that came from connecting with others. Lena was also observant and perceptive, noticing the smallest details that others might overlook. She was deeply emotional and felt things strongly, often sharing her feelings openly and honestly.
