Iteration 3 answer: In the quiet solitude of my apartment, I often found myself lost in reverie, my thoughts wandering through the labyrinthine corridors of my mind. It was there, amidst the tapestry of my own imagination, that I discovered an intriguing puzzle. The puzzle was about a mysterious island, said to be floating somewhere in the vast ocean.
