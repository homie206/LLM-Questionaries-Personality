Iteration 3 answer: In the heart of the bustling city of New York, there was a small, cozy café called "Whispering Words". It was a place where people from all walks of life came to escape the chaos of the city, to find solace or simply to meet up with friends. The café had been around for decades, and it was known for its unique blend of books, music, and conversation that created a warm, inviting atmosphere.
