Iteration 3 answer: Lily had always been a curious soul, drawn to the unknown and the unexplored. She was a high school student who loved nothing more than spending her free time reading books that were far from the typical fiction novels. Her mind was always wandering towards the vast array of theories and possibilities beyond what was taught in school.

It was an ancient tome about the lost city of Atlantis, which had been discovered in the depths of the ocean. Intrigued by its title, she decided to take it home.
