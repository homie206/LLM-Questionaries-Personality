Iteration 1 answer: In the quiet solitude of my small apartment, I found myself drawn to a peculiar hobbyâ€”collecting old postcards. They were simple, rectangular pieces of paper with pictures on one side and messages on the other, each one telling a different story from a different time and place. The stories were often mundane, yet somehow imbued with a sense of mystery and wonder. I would spend hours flipping through them, imagining the lives that had once been captured in those images.
