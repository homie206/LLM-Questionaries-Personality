Iteration 1 answer: In the heart of a bustling city stood a small, unassuming café named "Whispers." It was nestled between a towering office building and a row of old, ivy-covered townhouses. The café had been around for decades, known mostly for its quaint decor and the warm, inviting atmosphere it created. What many didn't know was that it was also a hub for creative minds and budding entrepreneurs.

One sunny afternoon, a young woman named Eliza walked into Whispers with her laptop and a sketchbook. She had just graduated from college with a degree in graphic design and was looking for ways to make her fledgling business ideas a reality. As she sat down at one of the cozy tables, she felt a mix of excitement and anxiety about her first visit to this place.

Maya leaned forward, her interest clearly piqued. "That sounds fascinating," she said. "Tell us more."

Eliza took a deep breath, ready to dive into her pitch.
